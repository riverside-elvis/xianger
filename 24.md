# Chapter 24

喘者不久
Those who pant do not endure.[^xianger-42]

> 用氣喘息
不合清靜
不可久也
Those who employ pneumas and pantingly inhale and exhale
do not accord with clarity and stillness
and will not long endure.[^24-1]

跨者不行
Those who stride do not walk.

> 欲行千里
一步而始
積之以漸
A journey of ten thousand *li*
begins with a single step and
is accomplished gradually through the accumulation of such steps.
今大跨而立
非能行者也
Now, those who take a great stride and then stand
are not capable travelers.
不可久也
They will not long endure.

自見不明
One who makes himself visible is not bright.
自是不彰
One who considers himself right is not prominent.
自饒無功
One who spares himself garners no merit.
自矜不長
One who pities himself has no longevity.

> 復解前章之意耳
This explains more fully the significance of the preceding passages.

其在道
As for their residence in the Dao... [^xianger-43]

> 欲求仙壽天福
要在信道
The crux for seeking Transcendent longevity and heaven's blessing
resides in keeping faith with the Dao.
守誡守信
不為貳過
罪成結在天曹
One should keep the precepts in good faith
and refrain from committing transgressions or contrary acts,
for sins will be tallied up among the celestial officers.
右契無到而窮
不復在余[^rse-24-1]也
When the tallies of the left are depleted,
you will not be granted any more chances.[^24-2]

曰餘[^rse-24-2]食餟行
物有惡之
\[I\] say: living beings shun such activities as using excess food to offer before the spirits.

> 行道者生
Those who practice the Dao live;
失道者死
those who lose the Dao die.
天之正法
不在祭餟禱祠也
The correct law of heaven
does not reside in offering foodstuffs and praying at ancestral shrines.
道故禁祭餟禱祠
與之重罰
Thus the Dao has prohibited these things
and provides heavy penalties for them.[^24-3] 
祭餟與耶通同
Sacrifices and food offerings are a means of commerce with deviant forces.
故有餘食器物
道人終不欲食用之也
Thus, even when there is "excess food" or implements [left over from sacrifices],
Daoists will not eat or employ them.[^24-4]

故有道不處
Therefore, those who possess the Dao will not be found there.

> 有道者不處祭餟禱祠之間也
Those who possess the Dao will not stay where there are offerings of foodstuffs or praying at ancestral shrines.
