# Chapter 36

將欲翕之
必固張之
That which will be made to shrink
must have been enlarged.

> 善惡同規
Good and evil follow the same pattern;
禍福同根
fortune and misfortune have the same root.
其先張者後必翕
Where they first extend, they will later shrink.

將欲弱之
必固彊之
That which will be made weak
must have been strengthened.

> 先彊後必弱
What is at first strong is later weak.

將欲廢之
必固興之
That which will be destroyed
must have been flourishing.

> 先興後必衰廢
What at first flourishes will later certainly be weakened and destroyed.

將奪之
必固與之
That which can be taken
must have been increased.

> 先得後必奪也
What is first gained will later be taken away. 

是謂微明
This is called "subtle wisdom."

> 此四事即四怨
四賊也
The four things [listed above] are the "four grievances"
or the "four thieves."
能知之者
微且明
Those who know them are subtle and wise.
知則副道也
Knowing them, you may aid the Dao.
道人畏翕弱廢奪
Daoists fear shrinking, weakness, destruction, and loss.
故造行先自翕自弱自廢自奪
然後乃得其吉
Thus, in framing their actions, they first make themselves shrink, make themselves weak, make themselves useless, and make themselves depleted
so that later they may obtain propitious results.
及俗人廢言
先取張彊興之利
然後返兇矣
Now, as for the destructive words of the profane,
they advocate the benefits of first becoming extended, strong, exalted, and well endowed,[^xianger-60]
so they later face the resulting inauspicious results.
故誡知止足
令人於世間裁自如
This is why you are admonished to know sufficiency
and why humans in the world are enjoined to diminish themselves.
便思施惠散財除殃
不敢多求
They should concentrate on spreading benevolence, distributing their wealth, and eradicating misfortune
and not dare to seek more for themselves.
奉道誡者
可長處吉不兇
不能止足
相返不虛也
Those who revere the precepts of the Dao
may sit in auspiciousness forever, for it is not an empty saying
that those who do not know how to stop with sufficiency
will reap the opposite of their excess.[^36-1]
道人不可敢非
實有微明之知
Daoists do not dare to transgress this command,
for, in truth, they possess this subtle wisdom.

柔弱勝剛彊
The pliant and weak excel over the unbending and strong.

> 道氣微弱
The pneumas of the Dao are subtle and weak;
故久在無所不伏
thus they endure and overcome everything.
水法道柔弱
故能消穿崖石
Water is like the Dao in its pliancy and weakness
and so is able to dissolve or bore through massive rocks and cliffs.
道人當法之
Daoists should make water their model.

魚不可勝於淵
Fish may not overcome the watery depths.

> 誡為淵
道猶水
人猶魚
The precepts might be compared to the depths,
the Dao to water,
and the people to fish.
魚失淵去水則死
Once fish lose the depths and are taken from the water, they die.
人不行誡守道
道去則死
If people do not practice the precepts and maintain the Dao,
the Dao departs from them and they die.

國有利器
不可以視人
When the kingdom possesses an advantageous implement, it should not be shown to the people.

> 寶精勿費
Treasure your essences and do not squander them.
令行缺也
If you allow them to move, you will experience lack.
又一說曰
Another explanation says:
道人寧施人勿為人所施
the people of the Dao should rather act upon others than allow people to act upon them.
寧避人勿為人所避
They should rather avoid others and not be avoided by others.
寧教人為善勿為人所教
They should instruct others in the good and not be taught by others.
寧為人所怒勿怒人
They should be angered at others, not anger others.
分均寧與人多勿為人所與多
With impartiality they should give much to others, not receive much from others.
其返此者
即為示人利器也
Those who act contrary to this advice
are showing others the advantageous implement.[^36-2]
