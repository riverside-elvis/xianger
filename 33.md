# Chapter 33

知人者智
One who knows people possesses knowledge.

> 知平他人善惡
知不合道德
Those who can only assess the goodness and evil of others,
though knowledgeable, do not accord with the power of the Dao.
道人但當自省其身
令不陷於死地
The people of the Dao should reflect only upon their own persons
so that they do not sink into the land of the dead.
勿平他人也
They should not judge others.

自知者明
One who knows oneself possesses illumination.

> 如此甚明矣
Those who are like this are extremely bright.

勝人有力
One who overcomes others is forceful.

> 好勝人者
但名有力也
Those who delight in overcoming others
are forceful only in name.

自勝者彊
One who overcomes oneself is strong.

> 自修身行善勝惡
此乃彊也
To perfect one's body through practicing good and overcoming evil
is true strength.

知足者富
One who recognizes sufficiency is rich.

> 道與謙也
The Dao rewards the humble and retiring.

彊行有志
Those who practice in strength hold to their aspirations.

> 道誡甚難
The injunctions of the Dao are extremely difficult.
仙士得之
但志耳
The Transcendent nobility achieve the Dao
only by virtue of their wills.
非有伎巧也
They do not employ clever techniques.

不失其所者久
Those who do not lose what is theirs endure.

> 富貴貧賤
各自守道為務
People, whether wealthy or poor, exalted or humble,
should all make it their business to maintain the Dao.
至誠者道與之
Those who are completely sincere will have the Dao given them.
貧賤者無自鄙強欲求富貴也
The poor and lowly should not denigrate themselves through urgently seeking to become rich and exalted.
不強求者
為不失其所故久也
Those who refrain from such seeking
will not lose their place and will thus endure.
又一說曰
Yet another explanation states:
喜怒五行戰傷者
人病死
不復待罪滿地
when, through emotions of joy and anger, the five phases battle and are injured,
a person dies
even before the count of transgressions is fulfilled.
今當和五行
令各安其位勿相犯
You should harmonize the five phases
so that each peacefully occupies its place and one does not encroach upon the other.
亦久也
In this way also you will endure.[^33-1]

死而不亡者壽
Those who die without perishing are longevous.

> 道人行備
道神歸之
When a Daoist's practices are complete,
the spirits of the Dao call that person to return.
避世託死
遇太陰中
復生去為不亡
Departing the world through feigned death,
the person passes through Grand Darkness
to be born again and not perish.
故壽也
That is longevity.
俗人無善功
死者屬地官
Commoners have no good merits,
and when they die, they belong to the Earth Office.
便為亡矣
That is to perish.[^33-2]
