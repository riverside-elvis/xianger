# Chapter 23

希言自然
One who speaks infrequently is self-sufficient.

> 自然
道也
That which is "self-sufficient"
is the Dao.
樂清靜
It delights in clarity and stillness.
希言入清靜
合自然
"Infrequent speech" partakes of that clarity and stillness
and accords with that which is "self-sufficient";
可久也
thus it endures.

飄風不終朝
A whirlwind does not last out a morning.
趍雨不終日
Rainsqualls do not last a day.

> 不合清靜自然
故不久竟日也
Because they do not accord with clarity and stillness---that which is thus of itself---they do not last even a day.

孰為此天地
Who makes these? Heaven and earth.

> 孰
誰也
天地為飄風趍雨
為人為誡
不合道
故令不久也
Heaven and earth form whirlwinds and rainsqualls
as admonitions for humans,
to demonstrate that what does not accord with the Dao
will not endure.[^xianger-40]

天地尚不能久
而況於人
If even heaven and earth are not able to endure them,
what of humanity?

> 天地尚不能久
人欲為煩躁之事
思慮耶計
安能得久乎
Since even heaven and earth are unable to endure [such violent outbursts],
when human beings through desire engage in violent action
and plot various devious schemes,
how can they achieve longevity?

故從事而道得之
Thus, if one acts in accord with the Dao, the Dao[^xianger-41] will accept one.

> 而
如也
*Er*
means "in accord with."
人舉事令如道
道善欲得之
If people make their actions accord with the Dao in all things,
the Dao will benevolently seek to receive them.
曰自然也
This is called "self-actualization."

同於德者
德得之
If one accords with the powers,
the powers will accept one.

> 人舉事與德合
德欲得之也
If people's actions all accord with the powers [of the Dao],
the powers will wish to receive them.[^23-1]

同於失者
道失之
If one accords with those who miss it,
one will be abandoned by the Dao.

> 人舉事不懼畏道誡
失道意
道即去之
If people do not hold in awe the precepts of the Dao in all things
and miss the intentions of the Dao,
the Dao will depart from them.
自然如此
It is automatically so.

信不足
有不信
Those whose faith is insufficient
are faithless.

> 前章已說之也
This has been explained in previous sections.
