# Chapter 5

天地不仁
Heaven and earth are inhumane;
以萬物為芻茍
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.

> 天地像道
Heaven and earth are patterned on the Dao.
仁於[^rse-05-1]諸善
不仁於諸惡
They are humane to all those who are good,
inhumane to all those who do evil.
故煞萬物惡者不愛也
視之如芻草如茍畜耳
Thus, when they destroy the myriad things, it is the evil whom they hate
and whom they view as if they were grass or domestic dogs.

聖人不仁
The Sage is inhumane;
以百姓為芻茍
he treats the common people as if they were straw dogs.

> 聖人法天地
The Sage models himself on heaven and earth.
仁於善人
不仁惡人
He is humane to good people,
inhumane toward evil people.
當王政煞惡
亦視之如芻茍也
When kingly governance turns to destruction and evil,
\[the Sage\] also views the king as a straw dog.
是以人當積善功
其精神與天通
Thus people should accumulate meritorious actions
so that their essences and [internal] spirits communicate with heaven.
設欲侵害者
天即救之
In this way, when there are those who wish to attack and injure them,
heaven will come to their aid.
庸庸之人
皆是芻茍之徒耳
The common run of people
are all straw dogs;
精神不能通天
their essences and spirits are unable to communicate with heaven.
所以者
譬如盜賊懷惡
不敢見部史也
精氣自然
與天不親
生死之際
天不知也
The reason for this is that,
as robbers and thieves with evil intentions
dare not be seen by government officials,
their essences and spirits
are not in touch with heaven,
so that when they meet with dire extremities,
heaven is unaware of it.

> 黃帝仁聖
知後世意
故結芻草為茍
以置門戶上
欲言後世門戶
皆芻茍之徒耳
The Yellow Thearch was a humane sage
and knew the inclinations of later generations,
so he plaited straw to make a dog
and hung it above the gate,
desiring thereby to indicate that within these gates in later generations,
all would be straw dogs.
人不解黃帝微意
But people did not understand what the Yellow Thearch meant to imply.
空而效之
而惡[^rse-05-2]心不改
They merely copied this practice
without reforming their evil hearts.[^05-1]
可謂大患也
This is certainly a great evil.

天地之間
其猶橐籥[^rse-05-3]
The space between heaven and earth,
is it not like a bellows?

> 道氣在間
清微不見
The pneumas of the Dao reside in this space---clear, subtle, and invisible.
含血之類
莫不欽仰
All blood-bearing beings
receive them in reverence.
愚者不信
Only the ignorant do not believe this.
故猶橐者治工排橐
As a result the space is here compared to a bellows.
籥者可吹竹
氣動有聲
When the smelter works the bellows,
air moves through the tube---that is, the hollow bamboo pipe---with a sound.
不可見
\[Although there is something there,\] it cannot be seen.
故以為喻
以解愚心也
This is why it is here taken as a metaphor,
meant to explain the matter for the ignorant.

虛而不屈
Void, it cannot be exhausted.
動而愈出
The more movement there is, the more it emits.

> 清氣不見
像如虛也
The clear pneumas are invisible,
as if they were void.
然呼吸不屈竭也
Yet their breathing never is exhausted.
動之愈益出
The more they move, the more it is that emerges.

多聞數窮
Those with great learning are again and again depleted;
不如守中
best maintain the middle.

> 多知浮華
Those possessing great knowledge are superficial and ornate.
不如守道全身
They do not know how to hold to the Dao or to perfect the body.
壽盡輒窮
Once they live out their span of years, they will invariably be "depleted" [i.e., die].[^xianger-5]
數數非一也
"Again and again" means [that this has happened] more than once.
不如學生守中和之道
It is better to study life, to maintain the centrally harmonious Dao.
