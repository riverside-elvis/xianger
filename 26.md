# Chapter 26

重為輕根
靜為躁君
Weightiness is the root of lightness.
Quiescence is the lord of agitation.

> 道人當自重精神
Daoists should value their essence and spirits.
清靜為本
Clarity and stillness are the basis.[^26-1]

是以君子終日行
不離輜重
For this reason, though the gentleman might travel all day,
he does not forsake his baggage.

> 重精神清凈
君子輜重也
Value your essence and spirits in clarity and stillness,
for they are the "baggage of the gentleman."
終日行之
不可離也
Though you might travel [circulate them] all day,
you cannot leave them behind.[^26-2]

雖有榮觀
燕處超然
Even though he might have a glorious and comfortable palace,
transcending all others---

> 天子王公也
This refers to the child of heaven, princes, and ministers.
雖有榮觀
為人所尊
務當重清靜
Even though they might possess glorious palaces
and be honored by others,
they should strive to value clarity and stillness.
奉行道誡也
They should revere and practice the precepts of the Dao.

如何萬乘之主
以身輕天下
how could it be that the lord of ten thousand chariots
might consider his body more insignificant than [those in] his realm?

> 天子乘人之權
尤當畏天尊道
The child of heaven holds power over people,
so he especially should fear heaven and revere the Dao.
設誤意自謂尊貴
不復懼天道
即為自輕其身於天下也
If he, through mistakenly considering himself to be venerable, ceases to fear the Dao of heaven,
then he actually slights his own body over all others in the world.[^26-3]

輕則失本
Through belittling it, one loses the source.
躁則失君
Through agitation, one loses sovereignty.

> 輕躁多違道度
則受罰辱
Both slighting [the Dao] and agitation are extreme transgressions against the order of the Dao
and earn punishment and degradation.[^26-4]
失其本身
亡其尊推矣
In this way, you will lose your original body
and forfeit the motive forces that would ennoble you.
