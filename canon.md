_**Laozi Xiang'er zhu**_ 老子想爾注

Dunhaung manucript Stein 6825

Later Han (A.D. 25-220)

"Xiang'er Commentary to the *Laozi*."
This is one of the earliest glosses on the *Daode jing*,
and many sources mention this work,
probably of the Han period (206 B.C.-A.D. 220),
as once having been included in the *Daozang*.
*1430 Daozang quejing mulu* 1.6b lists the
*Xiang'er zhu Laozi daode jing* 想爾老子道德經,
in two juan, as lost.
Its partial recovery among the Dunhuang manuscripts is, therefore, fortunate.
Rao Zongyi has published the text in a critical edition.
It has also been reproduced and studied by Ōfuchi Ninji.

The Dunhuang manuscript fragment contains only the text of the first juan
of the *Daode jing*, the so-called *Dao jing* 道經,
and the first two chapters are missing.
The text begins with the phrases of the third chapter:
"By not seeing things that can be desired, the heart will not be troubled"
(*bu jian ke yu ze xin bu luan* 不見可欲, 使心不亂)
and ends with the thirty-seventh chapter and the title of the Tao by Laozi,
First Part, Xiang-er (*Laozi Daojing, shang, Xiang'er* 老子道經, 上, 想爾).
The manuscript, 26.7 cm high and 9 m long, has 585 columns
with an irregular number of characters written in neat clerical script.
Remarkably, the commentary following each sentence
is written in exactly the same way as the main text,
without any punctuation or other mark to separate the two.
This style is archaic. The manuscript is not dated.
Given the style and the paper, it might date from the Six Dynasties (220-589),
and it probably came from North China
(see Rao Zongyi, *Laozi Xiang'er zhu jiaozheng*, 5).

It is not known who Xiang'er was.
The earliest mention of the name occurs in
*789 Zhengyi fawen tianshi jiaojie kejing*,
which contains a collection of some of the oldest texts
of the Way of the Heavenly Master,
dating from the Three Kingdoms period (220-265).
The second text (12a-19b), titled Rules Governing the Family of the Tao
(*Daode jialing jei* 大道家令戒)
and dating to about 255, is a short treatise on the religious policy
of the ecclesia.
It refers on page 14b to *Xiang'er* as a book that the faithful should heed.
However, as the passage is obviously corrupt (four characters are missing),
it is impossible to decide whether it refers to the commentary
of the *Daode jing* or to the commandments of Xiang'er
(*Daode jing Xiang'er jie* 道德經想爾戒)
that had to be obeyed by those who received this scripture
(see *786 Taishang laojun jinglü* 1a-b).
In any case, the two, commentary and commandments, are closely related.
The name *Xiang'er* here refers to an important doctrinal work that,
together with two other fundamental texts
(the *Huangting jing* 黄庭經 and the now lost *Miaozhen jing* 妙眞經),
deserved special respect.
Indeed, whereas the Way of the Heavenly Master
apparently did not itself produce any major doctrinal work,
it did transmit and use a number of ancient doctrinal texts,
such as the *Daode jing*, the *Taiping jing* 太平經,
and the *Huangting jing*.

In later times, the Xiang'er commentary came to be considered
the work of Zhang Daoling 張道陵,
the founder of the Way of the Heavenly Master,
or of his grandson Zhang Lu 張鲁 (d. 216).
In his prefatory treatise (*xulu* 序錄) to his *Jiandian shiwen*,
Lu Deming 陸德明 (556-627) mentions Xiang'er
(the printed edition mistakenly writes "*xiangyu* 想余";
see Rao Zongyi, *Laozi Xiang'er zhu jiaozheng*, 4)
and states:
"it is not clear who he is; some say Zhang Lu, some say Liu Biao 劉表."
Liu Biao (d. 218) refers to the famous military commander
at the end of the Han dynasty.
The latter attribution is so improbable as to suggest that
by the time of Lu Deming the identity of Xiang'er
was completely lost to oblivion.

In the liturgical organization of the Tang,
the transmission of the *Daode jing* and its commentaries
formed a separate stage of initiation and ordination.
The corresponding ordination ritual of the early Tang has been preserved in
*1238 Chuanshou jingjie yi zhujue*.
The author of this ritual discusses the ranking of texts and says that
the Xiang'er commentary should come third, after the plain text
of the *Daode jing* (the so-called "great character text," *Dazi ben* 大字本)
and the Heshang gong commentary (*682 Daode jing zhenjing zhu*).
According to this author, the commentary deserves this rank
because it was written by Zhang Lu, the Successor of the Master
(*xishi* 系師), who assumed the name of Xiang'er and wrote the work
in order to instruct the uncouth and primitive inhabitants of Sichuan.
Still later in the Tang period, Xiang'er became identified with
Zhang Daoling himself.
In the prefatory chapter of the second commentary
he wrote to the *Laozi* classic, Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712-756)
lists the Xiang'er commentary in second place (before Heshang gong)
and notes: "this commentary was made by Zhang Daoling,
the Ritual Master of the Three Heavens"
(see *679 Tang Xuanzong yuzhi Daode zhenjing shu*, Waizhuan 1b).
This text is taken over by Du Guanting,
in his *725 Daode zhenjing guangsheng yi* (preface, 2b).
It is clear, therefore, that the identification of Xiang'er
with either Zhang Lu or Zhang Daoling occurred at a rather late stage
and that the place of the commentary in the order of glosses
on the *Daode jing* was subject to discussion.

These issues have been debated by modern scholarship,
but without conclusive result.
The hypothesis that Xiang'er commentary was written by
the early Heavenly Masters raises the immediate problem of content and style.
The cosmology and theology of the early Heavenly Masters as expounded in
*789 Zhengyi fawen tianshi jiaojie kejing* and many other texts is well known
and bears little resemblance to the system of the Xiang'er commentary.
Another difficulty is that if the Xiang'er commentary
really were the work of the founders of the Heavenly Master ecclesia,
then why do none of the numerous texts that have come down to us
from this ecclesia mention or even imply such a relationship?

The Xiang'er commentary explains the thought of the *Daode jing* in terms of
Tending Life (*yangsheng* 養生) practices in often highly contrived glosses
with little or no relationship with what appears to be
the original meaning of the *Laozi* text.
Among other tenets, the commentary explains
that the Tao is present in the human body but cannot be seen,
and adepts should not attempt to visualize the Tao or, for that matter,
the deities of the body, such as the spirits of the Five Viscera and so on.
The Tao is personified in Taishang laojun 太上老君,
and he is therefore also the author of the *Laozi*.
Each time the word *I* occurs in the text, the commentary reminds us
that we have to understand this as the voice of the Tao
("*wu, Dao ye* 吾,道也"). The commentary addresses itself
to a community of believers ("*xin Dao* 信道) who are enjoined to respect
the commandments of the Tao (*Daojie* 道誡).
They should worship (*gongyang* 供養) the Tao but not offer sacrifice
(*ji* 祭), nor pray at ancestral shrines (*daoci* 禱祠).
This is one of the most stringent interdictions.
Great importance is attached to sexuality.
Sexual desires should be banned, sexual energy carefully preserved.
Males should learn to behave like women,
to curb their aggressiveness and ambition.
There is a heavenly bureaucracy (*tiancao* 天曹)
that keeps records of human sins.
Some, but not all, of these tenets are also found in the ecclesia
of the Heavenly Master, yet the style, the tone, and the theology
are quite different.
For all appearances, the Xiang'er commentary represents an earlier stage
of community Taoism than the ecclesia of the Heavenly Master.

This brings us to the problem of dating.
First there is the main text of the *Daode jing*
as it features in the Xiang'er commentary.
As we have seen, we do not find the division into chapters that are present
in the Heshang gong and Wang Bi versions.
In other respects, the text is much the same.
In two instances, however, the Xiang'er text omits a sentence:
the words "*wei wuwei* 為無為" in chapter 3,
and "*dajun zhi hou, bi you xiong nian* 大軍之後, 必有凶年" in chapter 30.
It is important to note that in both versions
of the *Daode jing* discovered in 1973 in Han tomb no. 3 at Mawang dui
near Changsha (Hunan), which date from the second century B.C. or earlier,
these sentences are also lacking.
Other minor evidence also suggests that the Xiang'er text
is closer to the Mawang dui versions than to any other
of the early *Laozi* versions.
Even the special way the numeral 30 is written, which has been considered
a typical indication that the version was made by Zhang Lu
(see Rao Zongyi, *Laozi Xiang'er zhu jiaozheng*, 4),
can be found in the Mawang dui manuscripts.

Could the Xiang'er commentary be older than the Heshang gong commentary?
Rao Zongyi has reached the opposite conclusion, pointing to many instances
where the two commentaries are similar and assuming that
Zhang Daoling was the author of the Xiang'er commentary.
Other scholars have followed suit, without offering significant new evidence.
Yet the question cannot be said to have been settled conclusively.
Within the limits of the present article, we can observe only that
in all the instances where the two commentaries are manifestly similar,
it is impossible to establish which copies the other or whether both draw on
a common exegetical tradition.
In conclusion, the Xiang'er commentary could, therefore,
date from the Later Han period, possibly from as early as
the first century A.D.
