# Chapter 20

絕學無憂
唯之與何
\[Called to\] eliminate learning without worry,
what will those who assent be given?
相去幾何
How great is the difference?

> 未知者復怪問之
Those who do not yet know still doubt and ask:
絕耶學
道與之何
"Were I to discard deviant learning,
would the Dao bestow something upon me?
耶與道相去近遠
How great is the difference between the Dao and the deviant?"
絕耶學
獨守道
道必與之
If they were to abandon deviant learning
and cling only to the Dao,
the Dao would certainly be given to them.
耶道與耶學甚遠
The difference between the Dao and the deviant ways with their perverted teachings is great.
道生耶死
The Dao is life, and deviance, death.

生屬天
The dead belong to earth
and the living to heaven.[^20-1]
故極遠
This is how far apart they are.

美之與惡
相去何若
The pleasing and the repellent[^20-2]---how
far apart are they?

> 未知者復怪問之
欲知美惡相去近遠何如
道與耶學近遠也
Those who do not yet know still doubt and question,
wanting to know how the difference between the pleasing and the repellent
compares with the difference between the Dao and deviant learning.
今等耳
The discrepancy is the same.
美
善也
"Pleasing"
refers to moral goodness.
生故屬天
惡死亦屬地也
It is a living force and thus belongs to heaven,
just as the repellent is death and belongs to earth.

不可不畏
莽其未央
That which human beings fear,
they cannot but fear---yet
vast the number of those not yet ready.

and death to threaten the evil.
