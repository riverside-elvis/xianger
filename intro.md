# Appendix: Introduction

The following is the "Intoduction"
to "The _Xiang'er_ Commentary to the _Laozi_"
from _Early Daoist Scriptures_,
Stephen R. Bokenkamp, 1997.

---

The _Xiang'er_ commentary
is the earliest Daoist interpretation
of the _Laozi_
(also known as the _Daode jing_,
"Scripture of the Way and its Potencies").[^intro-1]
This text was employed by
the early Celestial Master organization
as a catechism to be recited and learned
by all the faithful.
The _Xiang'er_ thus represents
not only a Celestial Master interpretation of the _Laozi_,
but also an introduction to Celestial Master beliefs and practices.
The polemical tone of much of the commentary
demonstrates the missionary fervor
with which the Celestial Masters
strove to establish their religion.
The _Xiang'er_ defends its own tenets
against those of Confucianism
as well as against other forms of Daoist practice
and rival interpretations of the _Laozi_ text,
revealing in the process the extent to which
the early Celestial Masters saw themselves
as unique in practicing the teachings of a deified Laozi
and regarded the _Laozi_
as his initial revelation meant especially for them.

The fact that the _Laozi_ is so widely known and studied
should simplify the task at hand.
Paradoxically, the very popularity of the text
as the foremost representative of "Daoism"
and the astounding number of ways
in which it has been interpreted
make understanding the _Xiang'er_ commentary
that much harder---and more necessary,
for the _Laozi_ itself tells us nothing of the Daoist religion.

Although the Celestial Masters
accorded the _Laozi_ primacy over other revealed texts
as a catechism of their faith,
their veneration seems to have been directed
more to the figure of Laozi
(or Lord Lao, as he was called)
than to the ideas contemporaries found in the _Laozi_ itself,
for their interpretations often run counter
to the clear intent of the text.
Key words and phrases from the _Laozi_
occupy places of honor in later Daoist scripture,
but they often stand for practices and ideas
of which the original text is quite innocent.
Far and away the most widely cited classical source in Daoist writings,
the _Laozi_ was bestowed on new initiates
with the same rituals accorded the transmission of other scriptures,
but all of these activities
contradict the injunction of the _Laozi_ itself
that "knowledge" be discarded.[^intro-2].
Then, too, even within the Celestial Master organization,
the _Laozi_ did not maintain its preeminent position.
Further revelations from Lord Lao,
among which we might even want to number the _Xiang'er_ commentary,
at first supplemented and later largely eclipsed it.
The _Laozi_ thus did not remain,
as did the Torah or the Koran,
the canonical source of revealed wisdom,
to be returned to and reinterpreted subtly
at each stage in the development of the religion.
Clearly, to understand Daoism
it is the commentaries we need to study
rather than the _Laozi_ itself.

Commentaries are acts of interpretation.
Wittingly or unwittingly,
commentators reconfigure a text in line with their own concerns.
Because of this,
yet another distorting side effect
of the _Laozi_'s modern popularity
needs to be directly confronted at the outset.
Those readers who already have some idea of the _Laozi_,
especially if that idea is drawn
from any of the modern translations of the work,
may well feel that the _Xiang'er_ commentary
takes unwarranted liberties with a mystical book
designed for the cultivation of individual sage-hood.
Before succumbing to this initial impression, however,
we should recall that although the commentator
is undeniably reinterpreting the _Laozi_ in various ways,
we ourselves, after generations of reading the text
through the eyes of its medieval Chinese interpreters,
are only now beginning to rediscover
how that book was originally meant to be read.[^intro-3]
We thus need to reserve judgment
on the Daoist religion's supposed "distortions" of the _Laozi_,
proposed by various "degenerescence theories"
(to use Steve Bradbury's apt characterization)
that portray pure Daoist philosophy as corrupted by
the institutionalized and "popularizing" Daoist religion.[^intro-4]

The "real meaning" of the _Laozi_
is still hotly contested terrain,
as witnessed by the two or three new translations
that come out each year.
The introduction and translation presented here
are not intended to enter into that debate
or even to explore the place of the _Laozi_ within Daoism,
but to explicate the _Xiang'er_ commentary
and to learn from it as much as possible
about the early Celestial Masters.
I will thus not make reference to other translations
or interpretations of the _Laozi_,
nor will I attempt a thoroughgoing comparison
of the _Xiang'er_ understanding of the _Laozi_
with that of other commentators and translators,
a proceeding that would require another book
at least as long as this one.
In fact, as I will explain more fully,
I have, insofar as possible,
ignored other translations
in the interest of attending closely
to the readings of the _Xiang'er_ commentary.[^intro-5]

Thus we will begin
with an examination of the early history
of the Celestial Master movement.
This will be followed by a brief account
of the evolution of the _Laozi_
from a book of political gnosis
to a treatise for self-cultivation,
and the place of the _Xiang'er_ commentary in that process.
The two succeeding sections---"Meditation and Perfection of the Body"
and "Morality and Governance"---constitute an introduction
to the contents of the commentary itself
and to the doctrines of the Celestial Masters
that can be gleaned from it.
I will then introduce the controversies surrounding two topics:
the date of the text, and its authorship.
The former, I will argue,
is fairly certain---the text was written
before 215 C.E.---and the second is unknowable,
though the early statements that it was written by Zhang Lu
find no contradiction in the historical record.
At the end of the introduction,
the reader will find a brief discussion
of the principles and procedures I have followed
in making this translation
and a "Key to Chapter Numbers"
for those interested in comparing the _Xiang'er_ commentary
with other interpretations of the _Laozi_.

## Historical Background

The history of the early Celestial Masters
can be reconstructed from three types of sources:
dynastic histories and official inscriptions,
Daoist writings,
and Buddhist polemical treatises.
Each of these sources has its own bias,
and each contradicts the others in fundamental ways.
Historians of the period tended
to lump the Celestial Masters
with contemporary "rebel movements."[^intro-6]
In this and other ways,
they reveal their bias against the religion.[^intro-7]
Little interested in doctrinal matters,
contemporary historians failed to fully distinguish
the teachings and practices of the Celestial Masters
from those of other, similar groups.
Early Daoist sources are not, properly speaking,
histories of the movement at all.
Their references to the early church
often appear in the context of doctrinal discussion
and have clearly been adjusted accordingly.
Finally, Buddhist polemicists,
writing in defense of a religion that was under attack
as a danger to the state,
uniformly attempt to turn the tables on their rival, Daoism.
They report uncritically the basest allegations
and exploit the inattention of the historians
to associate all aspects of early Daoism
with rebel ideologies.

Here, then, we shall rely on
the first two types of writing---the standard histories and,
to a lesser extent, the reports of Daoists themselves---to trace
in broad strokes
the outlines of early Celestial Master history.
As is to be expected, given the nature of the sources,
there remains a great deal of scholarly debate on this subject.
Some alternative views will be presented in the footnotes.

Historians of the period
uniformly place the Celestial Masters
in some sort of relationship with the Yellow Turbans,
the most prominent among the rebel groups
that weakened the Han dynasty.
As the exact nature of the connection between these two groups,
if any, is disputed,
we first need to provide
some account of the Yellow Turbans.[^intro-8]

Centered in the eastern reaches of the Han empire,
the Yellow Turban rebellion,
led by a man named Zhang Jue,
was a well-planned movement
organized around a religious ideology
with definite millennial aims.
Zhang called his movement the "Way of Great Peace."
Under the slogan that the "Yellow Heaven is about to rise,"
he sought to position himself and his followers
as the vanguard of a new and perfect society.
Though historical evidence is necessarily scant,
it is almost certain that this ideology was
to some extent drawn from a revealed book,
the _Scripture of Great Peace_,
a work that had been promulgated earlier in the dynasty
by a court faction also centered in the eastern coastal region.
The _Scripture of Great Peace_,
which survives only in fifth- or sixth-century recensions,
promotes an ideal social structure
based on cosmic principles
and on the notion that the moral action of each individual
determines both the health of the body politic
and the smooth functioning of the cosmos.[^intro-9]

The Yellow Turbans converted people to their cause
through healing practices,
including old methods such as
incantation and doses of water infused with the ashes of talismans,
and a new one---confession of sins.[^intro-10]
This latter practice is significant.
The _Scripture of Great Peace_ relates confession
to the idea that political and cosmic disease are caused by humans
and must be cured on the individual level.
Sin, in this text, is the failure to act
in accord with one's social role,
thereby blocking the circulation of the Dao's energies.
Those who should labor with their bodies fail to do so,
living instead in idleness;
those who possess wealth keep it for their own enjoyment
rather than allowing it to circulate;
and those who should teach virtue only "accumulate" it,
making a name for themselves.[^intro-11]
These and other means of blocking the circulation
of goods and life forces lead, by this account,
to illness and death.
We shall find a similar attitude in the _Xiang'er_ commentary.

Zhang Jue organized his followers
into thirty-six administrative regions.
Apparently basing himself on the _Scripture of Great Peace_,
with its figure of a Celestial Master (or Heavenly Teacher)
who was to advise the perfect ruler,
Zhang took the title "Great Sage, Excellent Teacher."
He also named himself General of Heaven,
bestowing on his two brothers
the titles General of Earth and General of Humanity.

The new age of the Yellow Heaven was to dawn in the year 184,
the beginning of a new sexagesimal cycle by the Chinese calendar.
Despite well-laid plans, news of Zhang Jue's uprising reached the court,
and the Yellow Turbans in the east were defeated within the year.

Like the Yellow Turbans, the Celestial Masters
revered as founders three members of a Zhang family.[^intro-12]
In this case, though, the three were father, son, and grandson,
who led the movement in succession.
The histories record that the father,
Zhang Ling (Zhang Daoling in Daoist texts)
was a man of Pei (in northwestern Jiangsu Province)
who traveled to the kingdom of Shu (the western part of modern Sichuan)
to study the Dao on Mount Crane-Call.[^intro-13]
Daoist texts record that there, in the year 142 C.E.,
he was visited by the "newly appeared Lord Lao,"
the deified Laozi.[^intro-14]
Laozi granted him the title "Heavenly [-appointed] Teacher"
or Celestial Master.
On Zhang Ling's death,
the title was passed on to his son Heng
and eventually to his grandson, Lu.
The line of transmission, it is claimed,
remains unbroken this day.
These are the Celestial Masters
from whom the religion takes its name.

Little is provided in the way of a history
of the Celestial Master community
until the events sweeping China
in the latter years of the Han dynasty
finally penetrated as far as
the relatively isolated Sichuan Basin.[^intro-15]
According to the _History of the Latter Han_ (_Hou Han shu_),
in the seventh month of 184
(the same year in which the Yellow Turbans rose and were defeated),
another man surnamed Zhang, Zhang Xiu,
led a rebellion in the southwest.
His group, known as "the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice,"
was not suppressed.
Piecing together bits of information from the histories,
Ōfuchi Ninji has suggested that Zhang Xiu
must have been one of the parish leaders
of the Celestial Master movement.[^intro-16]

We meet Zhang Xiu again in 191.
Accompanied by the third Celestial Master, Zhang Lu,
he is on his way to Hanzhong,
another isolated valley,
though north of and not nearly so large as the Sichuan Basin.
The two Zhangs have been, according to the historians,
dispatched by the military governor of the province
to take this region as a buffer between Sichuan and the capital.
Zhang Xiu was killed and Zhang Lu subsequently established himself
and his followers in the Hanzhong region.[^intro-17]
The community remained in Hanzhong, according to the histories,
for some thirty years.[^intro-18]
At a time of extreme turbulence and warfare,
Zhang Lu is reported to have fought only defensively
and to have resisted the entreaties of his followers
that he take the title "king"
and move to establish a new dynasty.[^intro-19]

Despite his earlier connections
with the branches of the Han imperial family
that established themselves in Shu,
during the period in Hanzhong,
Zhang Lu was wholly independent.[^intro-20]
It was during this time
that the religious community described later on
was in operation.
The community was compelled to disband in 215,
when Zhang Lu surrendered to the Wei general Cao Cao.
After the surrender,
Zhang Lu, his five sons, and his most prominent advisers
were enfeoffed and the Celestial Master faithful
were relocated to areas throughout the Wei kingdom.

This diaspora of the Hanzhong community
was to have decisive consequences
for the development of the Daoist religion,
for it caused what was in effect
a government based on religious doctrine
to reorganize itself along entirely new principles of cohesion.[^intro-21]
This metamorphosis will be explored more fully later.[^intro-22]
Here we will focus on the early Celestial Master community of Hanzhong.

The histories, as we have noted,
describe the religion of the Celestial Masters
in ways strikingly similar to their accounts
of the practices of the Yellow Turbans.
The Celestial Masters also cured illness through confession.
They taught honesty and loyalty and eschewed deception.
When followers became ill,
they were to confess their transgressions
and were given "talisman water" to drink.
For the purposes of confession,
there were "chambers of quietness"
where the ill might reflect on their faults
and perform the proper ritual penances.
If they were not cured thereby,
the failure was said to be caused
by their not keeping faith with the Dao.

There were further rites performed on behalf of the ill.
Supplications were made in the form of written documents in three copies.
One would be placed on a mountaintop, addressed to heaven;
one buried in the earth;
and one cast into the water.
These were called the "hand petitions to the Three Offices."

Even the scant records of the historians
indicate that everyone was regarded as "ill" in one way or another.
Those newly converted to the Way of the Celestial Masters
were known as "revenant forced laborers" (*guizu*).
The latter part of the name was the term
used in Han administration for those who owed corvée service to the state,
usually military duty or the construction of roads, dikes, and so forth.
And, in fact, one of the punishments exacted by the Celestial Masters
for minor offenses was road-repair duty.
The first part of the name seems to refer
to the notion we find in the commentary
that all those who do not act in accord with the Dao
are no more than "mobile corpses."[^intro-23]
Converts to the religion, then,
may have been regarded as "revenants"---those from among the "living dead"
who had returned to the true source of life
and thus owed a debt of service to the Dao.

We know quite a bit more of the social organization
of the Celestial Masters than we do
of that of the short-lived Yellow Turbans.
The faithful were divided into twenty-four "administrations" or parishes,
each headed by a Libationer.[^intro-24]
The Libationers instructed the people by means of the _Laozi_,
which was to be memorized by chanting it in unison.
In this way, even illiterate parishioners could be instructed.

From Daoist texts we know that the people
were required to gather at the parishes three times each year,
on the seventh day of the first month,
the seventh day of the seventh month,
and the fifth day of the tenth month
by the lunar calendar.[^intro-25]
On these occasions,
their records of birth and death would be verified
and communal meals would be held.
Also, on these occasions, each family of the faithful
would contribute five peck-measures of rice as a faith offering.
It is from this practice that the Celestial Masters gained the nickname
"the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice," or, in less favorable sources,
"the Rice Bandits."

We even have some indication, in historical sources,
of the means used to spread the religion.
Along the roads leading into and through their areas of control,
the Libationers set up "responsibility huts" (*yishe*),
constructed something like the post-houses of the day.
"Travelers"---in the days of disorder proceeding the end of the Han,
more likely these were refugees---were invited to eat their fill
of the rice and meat stored in these huts,
but were warned that those who took excess would fall ill,
in accord with the "way of the revenants."
For those who broke the ordinances of the Celestial Masters,
three pardons would be issued.
Only then would punishment be meted out.
Such leniency and concern for the sufferings
of the common people had its effect.
The historians recount that commoners and non-Chinese peoples alike
rejoiced in the rule of the Celestial Masters.

This, then, was the community for whom the _Xiang'er_ commentary was written.
It was a mixed group, including both Han Chinese
and sinicized members of other ethnic groups.
As we will see later,
the _Xiang'er_ was the first commentary to the _Laozi_
to be written for the common people
rather than an elite readership.
The text's goals are also clearly religious.
One immediate conclusion to be drawn from these facts
is that the _Xiang'er_ commentary is less a "commentary"
than a treatise that uses the _Laozi_ as a point of departure.
In the following section, we will see what this means.

## The Body of the Dao

Any commentary on the _Laozi_ will, of necessity,
devote a great deal of space to the nature of the Dao,
the cosmic principle underlying the order of existence.
Despite this, the _Xiang'er_ commentator
shows little inclination toward mysticism,
being much more concerned with what we might call a "practical metaphysics,"
a system of thought that derives moral and practical advice
for a living community from a cosmology that, though alien to us,
is not in itself mystical.
Unconcerned with epistemology and even less with spiritual intuition,
the commentary labors to provide a concrete description
of how the Dao functions in the world
and how humans should act to accord with it.
The source of this knowledge may have lain in
mystical insight or spirit possession,
but the commentary does not explain
how it---the commentary itself---came into being.

Just as the worldview of the text finds its basis
in the shared cosmology of the period,
so too the commentarial strategy of the _Xiang'er_ is, in many respects,
the same as that employed by any classical commentary of the period.
This methodology, known as *xungu* (explanation through sound glosses),
employs word-by-word exegesis that relies heavily
on the assumed etymological affinity of homophonous graphs.
For instance, at line 50, the commentary states,
"*Gu* [valley] means desire [*yu*],"
presumably suggesting that the latter graph is the correct one.[^intro-26]
The tendency to focus on key words in the text
appropriate to this method extends even beyond such paronomastic glosses.
Commenting on the line "The gate of the mysterious feminine
is the root of heaven and earth," the literal-minded commentator,
having explained that the "gate of the mysterious feminine" is the vagina,
goes on to assert that it is called the "root"
because it is "the very crux [of existence]."

What, then, is new in the _Xiang'er_?
Although it is not our purpose here
to compare early commentaries to the _Laozi_,
we do need to take note of
one important way in which the _Xiang'er_ commentary
differs substantially from
the influential commentaries
of Heshang Gong (second century C.E.?) and Wang Bi (226-249).
The _Laozi_ was not written for just anyone who wanted to cultivate the Dao
and become a Daoist sage, but primarily for the ruler
and those members of the governing class qualified to advise him.[^intro-27]
For such persons, the Dao was a cosmological system
of order to which human society should conform
under the governance of the sage,
who alone might perfectly embody the Dao.
The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi interpretations
depart from this original view.
These two early commentaries to the _Laozi_,
through which we today tend to read it,
were part of a trend that expanded the text's audience
to include all of the gentry class and, in the process,
altered significantly the nature of the Dao.
In line with the growing interest in eremitism during the Latter Han
and into the period of disunion,
the figure of the sage seems to have undergone a shift.
No longer was the term employed solely for the "enlightened ruler"
or for those select few who, like Confucius,
possessed the wondrous qualities of a heaven-appointed ruler.
The Dao now might be learned, even cultivated in solitude,
far from the demands of political life.
Although the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi commentaries
still recognized the sections of the _Laozi_
most specifically concerned with governance,
other sections---those dealing with the cosmological discernment
and other mystical attributes of the ruler---were now seen
as attainable by any member of the literati class
who desired to achieve sage-hood.
The hermit or gentleman in retirement,
who might occupy a high position under a good government
but was sure to withdraw under a decadent one,
could now benefit from the text.[^intro-28]

In being made available to those who strove to embody it, however,
the Dao was rendered the object of mystical pursuit.
Both the Heshang Gong commentary, with its emphasis on self-cultivation,
and that of Wang Bi, with its philosophical emphasis on "non-being,"
agree that the sage is first and foremost
 someone who transcends ordinary mortals in understanding and ability.
 In short, they hold that the _Laozi_
 was written for the privileged individual.

In this respect, the _Xiang'er_ commentary
 may prove closer to pre-Han interpretations of the _Laozi_.
 It is concerned, first and last,
with remaking society on the model of the Dao.
Passages of the text show clearly
that it was intended as a handbook for the enlightened ruler.
At the same time, however, the Celestial Masters
instructed all of the faithful by means of the _Laozi_.
This is because, as the _Xiang'er_ commentary explains,
each person must be in complete accord with the Dao in order for society,
and indeed the cosmos, to function perfectly.
The pursuit of sagehood is available, indeed required, of all,
not just the specially endowed
(who were without exception members of the elite class).
In this way, the _Xiang'er_,
while preserving more fully the original focus on rulership of the _Laozi_,
at the same time expands the audience of the text
even more than do the other, roughly contemporary, commentaries.
This aspect of the text will become apparent
as we explore the nature of the Dao expressed in the _Xiang'er_ commentary.

The _Xiang'er_ regards a deified Laozi, or Lord Lao,
as the hypostasis of the Dao
and his book as the "teachings of the Dao"
(*dao jiao*---the phrase that, in later texts,
came to designate the religion as a whole).[^intro-29]
Indeed, the two cannot be separated.
Lord Lao is the Dao and the Dao is Lord Lao.[^intro-30]
Through the _Laozi_, the book of the deified Lord Lao,
the Dao thus speaks directly to humans.[^intro-31]
Beyond Laozi's promulgation of the teachings, however,
his actions in the world are not explicitly described in the commentary.
Instead, the Dao itself is shown to function anthropomorphically.
The Dao possesses consciousness and movement, likes and dislikes.
It acts in the world not only through spreading its teachings,
but also by means of its pneumas,
which vivify all living things
and provide the motive force behind all existence.
Sometimes the pneumas of the Dao congeal to form "essences,"
which are the spirits that inhabit both the universe
and the bodies of human beings.
When allowed to flow freely,
the pneumas of the Dao move through everything,
providing the very stuff of life and movement.

This is especially true of human beings,
who at some time in distant antiquity were fully one with the Dao,
so much so that the Dao "took humanity as its name."
Although the text does not expound on the nature of this primal purity,
it is clear that, from their privileged position of oneness with the Dao,
human beings were responsible for bringing about
the end of their perfect existence
through willfully perverting the pneumas of the Dao.
Once deviance entered the picture,
the nourishing Dao distanced itself from humanity,
and people began to die.[^intro-32]

Since human and cosmic suffering and death
are both traceable to mortal willfulness,
the rectification of the sorry situation in which humanity finds itself
must proceed on two interrelated fronts, the individual and the social.
Although the commentary treats these as two sides of the same coin,
we will explore them separately here,
under the headings "Meditation and Perfection of the Body"
and "Morality and Governance."
It should be kept in mind, though, that the body of society
and the body of the individual alike must,
in the worldview of the _Xiang'er_ commentary,
be returned to harmonious unity with the body of the Dao.
The two aspects are fundamentally the same,
though I will here attempt to treat them individually and,
insofar as is possible, without redundancy.

## Meditation and Perfection of the Body

The _Xiang'er_ commentary was clearly not meant as a meditation manual.
But, although it does not describe in detail any method of practice,
it does provide enough information for us to gain
some idea of the place of physiological practices
for healing and transcendence within the early Celestial Master movement.
Often, these techniques are discussed in the context
of distinguishing the correct methods mandated by the Dao
from those employed by what the text characterizes as
"those who practice false arts in the mortal world."
Although we cannot always determine
just who it is that the text is criticizing,
such passages are valuable in that they show us what the text means to defend.
The following account is based on these hints.[^intro-33]
What is known of rival schools of physical cultivation will,
for the most part, be relegated to the endnotes.

The basis for the practices thus alluded to in the _Xiang'er_
is the Dao itself.
Just as the Dao is composed of active pneumas
that coalesce into spirits,
so the human body is inhabited by spirits
that subsist on the pneumas of the Dao.
To achieve transcendence,
the individual must preserve and harmonize these internal spirits.

Desire, anger, and violent emotion represent destructive movement
of the pneumas and should be avoided.
Though it is true that one is injured less if,
according to the movement of the five phases,
the pneuma expressed is in the ascendancy,
even this depletes the energies of the body.
Thus, for instance, one is in less danger if one is angry
on a day when the red pneumas of the heart are at their apex,
though energies that might be better channeled are still wasted.

The commentary stipulates
that one should eradicate these deviant tendencies of the heart
in order that one may embrace "clarity and stillness."
The models in this pursuit are those already well known
from the _Laozi_ itself---the woman, the infant, and water---together with
a fourth, found only in the commentary: the Transcendent Noble.
Transcendent nobility is the state or condition to which
all of those to whom the commentary is addressed might aspire.
Transcendent Nobles "take the Dao as their name"
and are able to pass into the heavens without dying.

The term "clarity and stillness," then,
refers to the stilling of emotions
that is necessary to receive the life-giving pneumas of the Dao
and thereby nourish and perfect the internal spirits.[^intro-34]
This is achieved through meditation practice.
The "pneumas of morning and evening"
should be caused to descend into the human body,
where they should be mixed with the body's own pneumas
so that they are evenly distributed throughout---a technique
described as "most essential" and as having been established
by "the Master" for morning and evening practice.[^intro-35]

Although we have no specific instructions,
beyond the reference to morning and evening,
for the practice of "clarity and stillness,"
a few passages give some idea of how it might have been taught:

> Those who seek long life ... do not follow the common run of people
in their shifts and turns.
Instead, their thoughts are perfectly directed toward the Dao.
While they are learning to be clear and still,
their thoughts will temporarily be as if confused and muddy;
but since they are confused and muddy,
they have maintained simplicity and are about to reach their goal.
Finally, in clarity and stillness,
they will be able to observe all of the subtleties. (lines 197-200)

This state of confusion and muddiness
mirrors that of the undifferentiated pneumas of the Dao.
Humans who lack the quality of clarity and stillness
are compared to heaven and earth when they are troubled
by violent storm or other natural cataclysms.
That is, the pneumas of such persons are not integrated
and so the pneuma of one viscera lashes forth in violent emotion.[^intro-36]
Calmness and an unfocused psychophysical wholeness,
modeled on the undifferentiated, "confused" state of the Dao,
seem to be important for this sort of meditation.
This contrasts markedly, we are told,
with the visualizations practiced by others
who also claim to be Daoists.[^intro-37]

Elsewhere in the text we read that
"those who employ pneumas and pantingly inhale and exhale
do not accord with clarity and stillness
and will not long endure" (lines 367-68).
This injunction, we are informed,
also sets the methods of the Celestial Masters at variance
with those practiced by others---here most likely
the schools of hygiene.[^intro-38]
For the Celestial Masters, we are to understand,
pneuma is not simple "breath"---or even astral emanation---but
the very exhalation of the Dao itself,
the source of all life and the sustenance of celestial beings.
As the commentary puts it:

> Commoners eat grain, and when the grain is gone, they die.
The Transcendent nobility eat grain when they have it,
and when they do not, they ingest pneumas. (lines 319-20)[^intro-39]

Once inducted into the body, these pneumas must be guided throughout,
that they might nourish the body's resident spirits.
We learn of this practice in passages criticizing rival Daoist groups
who held that the Dao inhabited each of the five viscera in season
(according to a five-phase paced cycle),
where it might be discerned wearing garb of the appropriate color.
No, says the commentary.
"Entering into the space between heaven and earth,
[the Dao] comes and goes within the human body, that's all.
It is there everywhere within your skin,
not just in a single spot" (lines 107-8).
Clearly, it is the pneumas of the Dao
and not the Dao in its entirety
that might enter into the body, for elsewhere the text states:

> The heart is a regulator.
It may hold fortune or misfortune, good or evil.
The belly is a sack for the Dao;
its pneumas constantly wish to fill it.
When the heart produces ill-omened and evil conduct,
the Dao departs, leaving the sack empty.
Once it is empty, deviance enters, killing the person.
If one drives off the misfortune and evil in the heart,
the Dao will return to it and the belly will be filled. (lines 4-6)

The reference to the heart as regulator
is alluded to elsewhere in the commentary,
where we find the heart's regulating action styled
"the three paths of the Luminous Hall."[^intro-40]
The "Luminous Hall" was a ritual building of antiquity,
a model of the cosmos through which the king would move
in harmony with the supposed cycling of celestial pneumas.[^intro-41]
Here the concept is applied to the heart, king of the five viscera,
which is to conduct the third and most vital of three pneumas---the
three pneumas being yin, yang, and the "centrally harmonious,"
the last a blending of the previous two---through the adepts' body.[^intro-42]
The text is quite specific on this point:

> There are three streams in the heart.
Both yang deviances and the yin harm
should be shut up and not employed.
The central stream is the correct one. (lines 409-10)

This is the extent of the information that can be gleaned
from the _Xiang'er_ commentary on the practices it proposes
for "eating pneumas."
Undoubtedly, oral instructions would have included methods
for guiding the pneumas as they descend into the body,
blend, and are apportioned by the heart to the deities resident there,
but none of this finds expression here.

Another "false art" roundly savaged in the _Xiang'er_ commentary
is the method of sexual hygiene designed to replenish
a man's store of yin essence.
The substance of these critiques is made plain in the following passages:

> The Dao teaches people to congeal their essences and form spirits.
Today, there are in the world false practitioners
who craftily proclaim the Dao,
teaching by means of texts attributed to the Yellow Thearch,
the Dark Maiden, Gongzi, and Rongcheng.
They say that during intercourse with a woman
one should not release the semen, but through meditation
return its essence to the brain to fortify it.
Since their [internal] spirits and their hearts are not unified,
they lose that which they seek to preserve.
Though they control their delight,
they may not treasure it for long. (lines 86-89)

> Those who practice the _Classic of the Dark Woman_
and the methods of Gongzi and Rongcheng all wish to borrow.
But what creditor exists who will loan?
So they receive nothing. (lines 43 1-33)

Here, patrons of the arts of sexual hygiene,
some appearing in texts dating as early as the third century B.C.E.,
are mentioned by name.
In the context of these criticisms,
the _Xiang'er_ commentary advances its own methods
for physiological cultivation,
methods that can be identified with the ritual of "merging pneumas."[^intro-43]

The rite of "merging pneumas"
has been called the Celestial Master marriage rite.
In the surviving textual version of this practice,
it is described as being carried out under the direction of a master
and in austere ritual circumstances.[^intro-44]
The act of sexual penetration itself comes
only after a lengthy series of visualizations and massages
of one partner by the other, accomplished with both the hands and the feet.
Intercourse is also accompanied by incantation
designed to conjoin the pneumas of the partners,
strengthen the "five spirits" inhabiting their viscera,
and join the registers of deities
that the two adepts could visualize and summon.[^intro-45]

This was a practice roundly criticized
in both Buddhist and Daoist circles.[^intro-46]
Kou Qianzhi (d. 448) extended his animus
toward the ritual of "merging pneumas" even to the early church itself,
sharply criticizing the three Celestial Masters in the bargain.[^intro-47]
All of this, coupled with the fact that early works on hygiene
had been largely unknown up to the recent archaeological discoveries
at Mawangdui and Fangmatan, has led some scholars to question
whether the early Celestial Masters even employed the practice of
"merging pneumas."[^intro-48]
The very vehemence with which the _Xiang'er_ commentary
attacks the classics of sexual hygiene,
coupled with other hints scattered in the text,
makes it likely that they did.

*Jing*, the term I have been consistently translating as "essence,"
is regarded in the _Xiang'er_ as the concretion of pneuma.[^intro-49]
The pneumas of the Dao congeal to form spirits
both in the macrocosm and in the microcosm of the human body.
Within humans, though, this essence, like ice,
is prone to melt and leak away, resulting in death.[^intro-50]
Sexual intercourse is, at least for males,
one of the primary ways in which the vital essence might be lost.
As the commentary expresses it:

> The whitesouls are white in color.
For this reason, essence [here to be understood as semen] is white,
the same color as primal pneuma.
The body is the vehicle of the essence, and,
since essence tends to fall from it,
you should carry and manage it.
When the [internal] spirits are formed,
pneumas come to carry and manage the human body.
If you wish to complete this task, do not depart from the One.
The One is the Dao. (lines 102-5)

Essence forms spirits, and the spirits are nurtured
by further influxes of pneuma.
Essence tends to leak away, but the Dao, loving humanity
and desiring that the species continue,
has not mandated against all sexual intercourse.
It does make clear, however, that any outflow of essence
should be solely for the purpose of reproduction.[^intro-51]
The following passage, with its additional criticism
of mundane practices of sexual hygiene, elucidates these points:

> The Dao of yin and yang [i.e., sexual intercourse]
is therefore similar to congealing the essences to produce life.
At the age of fifty, having filled one's [productive] role, one should stop.
Even when one is young, though one possesses 
the capabilities for reproduction], one should rest [from intercourse]
and preserve [these potencies]....
If one from youth follows the path of lessening,
one will endure for a long time.
At present,
this matter [i.e., sexual intercourse] is the cause of great injury.
Why did the Dao create it?
The Dao places great emphasis on the continuation of ancestral sacrifice
and the survival of the species.
Desiring humanity to join their essences and so produce life,
the Dao teaches the youthful to preserve their essences
but not to cut them off.[^intro-52]
It does not teach humanity to labor [at intercourse].
This scheme of laboring [at intercourse] was thought up by the ignorant.
The Dao cannot be held responsible for it.
Those of higher virtue possess iron wills and are able to stop coupling
for the purposes of reproducing.
Thus they cut off the flow [of their essences] when they are young.
Moreover, in this way they are sooner able
to form beneficent [internal] spirits.
These are called "essences of the Dao." (lines 55-62)

This passage makes it plain that Daoists are to preserve their
essences and, optimally, refrain altogether
from "coupling for purposes of reproduction."
Concerned only with the preservation of essence,
the passage cannot be taken as evidence that the early Celestial Masters
did not practice the "merging of pneumas." In fact it does leave open
the possibility that they did encourage "coupling"
for purposes other than that of reproduction.

The passages immediately preceding the one just cited
explain that the bodies of women are patterned after the earth
and that women's sexual organs thus do not become rigid,
allowing women a natural ability to preserve their essences.
Men are enjoined to emulate them.
It is also revealed here that both the vagina and the penis
are called "the root."
The significance of this appellation, and of the commentary's concern
with the sexual organs, is made plain in yet another passage, which explains:

> When the pneumas of the Dao return to the root,
it is even more important to maintain clarity and stillness....
Knowing how to treasure the root in clarity and stillness
is the constant method of restoring one's life. (lines 219-20)[^intro-53]

Now, why should the pneumas of the Dao return "to the root"
if the role of the male sexual organ was merely to leak away essence?
We note, too, that "clarity and stillness" is vital
to the meditation practice described earlier
whereby the heart receives and correctly apportions the pneumas of the Dao.
This passage in fact deals with "pneumas" returning to the sexual organs,
and not essence.
Though the two are related, essence is the more condensed and vital,
in that it forms the spirits that inhabit the body.
It is to be preserved at all costs.
Pneuma, though it is the basic component of essence,
naturally moves in and out of the body as well as circulating within it.
The commentary does not say what was expected to occur when the pneumas
of the Dao return to the sexual organs,
but it is likely that this was regarded as the necessary precondition
for the rite of "merging the pneumas."[^intro-54]
Further, since the goal of all the practices involving pneuma mentioned here
was to achieve the blended "centrally harmonious" pneuma,
some sort of procedure designed to mix the excess yin and yang pneumas
of female and male so as to avoid "deviances of yang and injuries of yin"
would have been necessary.
*Heqi*, the "merging of pneumas," was precisely such a method.
Thus, though the term does not occur in the _Xiang'er_ fragment
remaining to us, the text does offer a rationale for the rite.

Finally, we need to look briefly at the goal of these practices,
the _Xiang'er_ concepts of transcendence.
Throughout the text, the ultimate aim of those fortunate humans
who are able to keep faith with the Dao
is described simply as "life" or as "enduring existence"
as a member of the "Transcendent nobility."
The details of this postmortem existence are not made entirely clear,
but, as Anna Seidel has pointed out, the _Xiang'er_ contains
perhaps the earliest mention of the "Palace of Greater Yin"
(or "Grand Darkness," as the term is translated here),
the place where the bodies of the fortunate dead
are transmuted and perfected:[^intro-55]

> Grand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao
refine their forms.
When there is no place for them to stay in the world,
the worthy withdraw and, feigning death, pass through Grand Darkness
to have their images reborn on the other side.
This is to be "obliterated without perishing."
The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds,
so when they die it is truly death.
They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices. (lines 227-30)

As I have explained in the general introduction,
Daoists do recognize the inevitable end of worldly existence.
The long life they sought was not extended life in this world,
but the avoidance of death, here described in terms of withdrawal,
"feigned death," and continued existence in the next life.
Always, as here, the "form," the physical body itself,
was considered vital to such postmortem existence.
There is no idea that only the spiritual constituents of the body
might fly off to a continued existence in the heavens.
The Palace of Grand Darkness, then, serves as the mechanism
for perfecting the physical constituents of the self
for such postmortem existence.
Those who fail to reach it
can expect to find themselves in the subterranean earth-prisons,
where they will, later texts tell us, undergo an equally physical existence,
but one of servitude, toil, and unremitting suffering.
The _Xiang'er_ commentary says no more about this destination,
though it is clearly an undesirable one.

Those who do pass through the Palace of Grand Darkness are reborn
"on the other side" as "images" of their former selves.
Presumably this "image" will be a perfected, "refined"---the metaphor
is metallurgical---simulacrum of their mundane bodies.
The text does not specify where the "other side" might be;
and there is no specific mention of rebirth or resurrection,
ideas we now know not to have been imported with Buddhism.[^intro-56]
It is not impossible that, just as Lord Lao (or "the Dao")
was believed to have been successively reincarnated,
so might the same have been believed of some of his more favored followers,
but the _Xiang'er_ provides no evidence.[^intro-57]

Whatever the ultimate destination,
the conception of the Palace of Grand Darkness presented here
is not divorced from the physiological practices explored earlier.
The commentary develops a homology between the "greater yin"
of the Palace of Grand Darkness and the lesser yin
of the urogenital vesicle *shen*,
where essence was thought to be stored within the human body.[^intro-58]
Just as the bodies of mortals might be refined
within the Palace of Grand Darkness to a more perfect, spiritual state,
so within the *shen* might the essences,
if they are not agitated or leaked away,
be formed into spirits to inhabit the body.
We shall see that the Shangqing school developed such ideas
to encompass the creation within the body of a perfected embryo
through absorption of solar and lunar pneumas,
which were mixed in the lower abdomen.
As the *shen*, the organ of reproduction, is emphasized here,
similar ideas might have underlain these practices as well,
but the text tells us no more about them.[^intro-59]

In later Daoist texts, similar practices
designed to vivify and unify the spirits of the body
are known under the name "preserving the One"
or "preserving unity" (*shouyi*).[^intro-60]
The _Xiang'er_ commentary emphasizes that
"those who keep the precepts and do not transgress them
have maintained Unity.
Those who do not practice the precepts will lose this Unity" (line 111).
Indeed, in what the text calls the "precepts of the Dao"
we read that adepts should not waste their essence and pneumas
and that one should not allow the essences to "overflow."
It is to these precepts
and to the more conventional moral and social aspects
of the _Xiang'er_ commentary that we now turn.

## Morality and Governance

Lines 206-7 of the commentary state in capsule form
one of the central messages of the _Xiang'er_ commentary:

> Whenever human beings wish to undertake some action,
they should first gauge it against the precepts of the Dao,
considering it calmly to determine that the principles of their action
do not contravene the Dao.
Only then should they gradually pursue it,
so that the Dao of life does not depart from them.

As the primary and paramount teaching of Lord Lao,
*the* embodiment of the Dao---in that
"the One [i.e., the Dao] disperses its form as pneuma
and gathers in its form as the Most High Lord Lao,
whose permanent rule is on Mount Kunlun"---the _Laozi_ text
was regarded by the early Celestial Masters as containing the rules
by which they must live
so as to accord with the intentions of the Dao and gain life.
Anyone who has attended to the startling variety of ways
in which people have interpreted the _Laozi_---in
Chan (Japanese "Zen") contexts;
in modern China, Taiwan, and Singapore;
even among New Age movements in the United States---will
recognize that this is no simple proposition.

Unlike Wang Bi, who drew inspiration from the _Yijing_,
the _Xiang'er_ commentator has not interpreted the _Laozi_
in light of other texts.
His sources of inspiration,
beyond perhaps the _Scripture of Great Peace_, remain unknown.
Although we know next to nothing of his sources and methods
in deriving meaning from the _Laozi_,
we do have evidence of the results.

Chen Shixiang, Ōfuchi Ninji, and others
have identified in the Daoist canon various scriptures
that list the "_Xiang'er_ precepts."
These are divided into nine prescriptive precepts---the
"Nine Practices"---and twenty-seven proscriptive precepts.
The former are drawn from the wording of the _Laozi_ itself
and the latter from the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
Both the "Nine Practices" and the "_Xiang'er_ precepts,"
as I will call the latter group,
are further divided into three groups---upper, middle, and lower.
This ordering foregrounds the numerology of the precepts---they appear
in multiples of three and nine---rather than emphasizing
any hierarchy of importance.[^intro-61]
Though there are slight differences in wording,
the various sources of the precepts are remarkably uniform
and close in wording to the _Xiang'er_ itself.
The precepts are as follows:[^intro-62]

The Nine Practices (extracted from the _Laozi_)

1. Practice lacking falseness.
1. Practice flexibility and weakness.
1. Practice maintaining the feminine. Do not initiate actions.
1. Practice lacking fame.
1. Practice clarity and stillness.
1. Practice good deeds.
1. Practice desirelessness.
1. Practice knowing how to cease with sufficiency.
1. Practice yielding to others.

The _Xiang'er_ Precepts (extracted from the Commentary)

All begin "You are admonished...":

1. Do not delight in deviance. Delight is the same as anger.
1. Do not waste your essence and pneumas.
1. Do not injure the ascendant pneumas.
1. Do not consume beasts that contain blood, delighting in their flavor.
1. Do not envy the achievements and fame of others.
1. Do not practice false arts or point to any shape and call it the Dao.
1. Do not neglect the law [i.e., the doctrine and ritual practices] of the Dao.
1. Do not act recklessly.
1. Do not kill or speak of killing.
1. Do not study deviant texts.
1. Do not covet glory or seek it strenuously.
1. Do not seek fame.
1. Do not be deceived by your ears, eyes, or mouth.
1. Place yourself in a humble position.
1. Do not slight [the Dao] or become agitated.
1. Consider carefully all undertakings and do not be flustered.
1. Do not pamper your body with good clothes and fine foods.
1. Do not allow [your emotions and vital forces] to overflow.
1. Do not, through poverty, seek strenuously after wealth.
1. Do not commit any of the various evil acts.
1. Do not overly observe the interdictions and taboos.
1. Do not pray or sacrifice to demons and spirits.
1. Do not be obstinate.
1. Do not consider yourself inerrant.
1. Do not contend with others over right and wrong.
When you meet the contentious, flee them.
1. Do not proclaim [yourself to be a] Sage
or contribute to the fame of the mighty.
1. Do not delight in arms.

Even a cursory glance at these lists shows that morality is here defined
in such a way as to encompass the necessity
of physiological cultivation practices.
Of the "Nine Practices," "clarity and stillness," as we saw earlier,
refers to a specific form of pneuma ingestion.
The injunction that one should "maintain the feminine"
and not "initiate actions," as well as numbers 2 and 18
of the _Xiang'er_ precepts,
are most likely related to the practice of sexual abstinence
outside of reproduction and the ritual "merging the pneumas."
Even the various injunctions against
anger, envy, obstinacy, desire, and delight
are, as we have seen,
related to the proper management of the body's pneumas
and the cultivation of internal spirits.
It is no wonder, then, that the accomplishment of good deeds (*shanxing*)
was thought to lead to prolonged physical existence,
both in this world and beyond.
The commentary expresses this in a vivid parable:

> The essences might be compared to the waters of a pond
and the body to the embankments along the sides of the pond.
Good deeds are like the water's source.
If these three things are all complete, the pond will be sturdy.
If the heart does not fix itself on goodness,
then the pond lacks embankments and the water will run out.
If one does not accumulate good deeds,
the pond is cut off at its source and the water will dry up.
If one breaches the dike to irrigate fields as if it were a river or stream,
then, even though the embankments hold,
the original flow will leak off too and the pond will empty.
When the bed of the pond becomes scorched and cracked,
that is the various illnesses all emerging.
If one is not cautious about these three things,
the pond will become an empty ditch. (lines 329-33)

The text's emphasis on morality extends beyond self-preservation, however,
to those social actions
that we normally subsume under the heading of morality,
but in ways that are very different
from the conventional Confucian-inspired moral systems of ancient China.
As an entry into this aspect of the text,
let us first look at one of the key concepts of the _Laozi_,
that of *wu wei*.

The very first of the "Nine Practices" enjoins one to "practice *wu wei*."
William Boltz has pointed out a key passage
in which the _Xiang'er_ manuscript interpolates
the concept of "*wu wei*" into the _Laozi_
where the term does not figure in the Mawangdui manuscripts.[^intro-63]
This is not yet the *wu wei* of Wang Bi, however.
The *wei* of *wu wei* is in this text to be understood
in terms of its close cognate *wei*,
"artificial, contrived, fabricated, false."
Thus, "material goods lead to artifice" (line 142),
and the *wu wei* of an infant comes about because
"infants are unaware of self-control" (line 113)
and so cannot act willfully.
Adherents are not enjoined not to act, but to still their hearts,
to quiet the winds of passion, and to make the movements of the Dao
their own through following its precepts.
They are forbidden to act in evil ways,
which for this text means "contrived" ways
that originate in the human will and passions.[^intro-64]
For *wu wei*, then, I have employed for this text
various rather cumbersome translations
such as "uncontrived," "lacking human artifice,"
or even "lacking willfulness"
rather than the more wieldy terms "inaction" and "nonintervention"
usually relied upon in translations of the _Laozi_.[^intro-65]

So defined, *wu wei* is closely connected to another important concept
of the _Xiang'er_ commentary,
that of *xie*, "perversion, deviance."[^intro-66]
The opposite of  *xie* is *zheng*, "upright, morally correct,"
and, in fact, the way of the Celestial Masters is known in this text
as the "correct law" or, in other early texts, "correct Unity"---the
"Unity" or "One" being at once the Dao
and the integrated state of the person
who fully receives its life-giving pneumas.
"Deviance" is any tendency that departs from the guiding course of the Dao.
On the macrocosmic level,
storms, stellar anomalies, violent wind, and other natural calamities
are the result of perversion of the Dao's life-giving pneumas.
Interestingly, even these are the result of human misdeed,
since the Dao causes them as a warning for human beings.
The primal age of "Great Peace" can be recovered
only when humans return to the "correct" or "perfect" law
revealed to them by Lord Lao.

Among the "deviances" are a number of physiological practices
discussed earlier as well as another that will concern us here,
Confucian morality.
The disdain shown by the _Laozi_ for the primary Confucian moral concepts
is well known.
The _Xiang'er_ commentary intensifies this attack
and places it within the all-embracing framework of its metaphysics.
According to the commentary, the Dao "taught Confucius all that he knew"
and his followers "have not kept faith with the writings of the Dao,
but merely revere Confucius's writings,
considering them the highest."[^intro-67]
Contemporary Confucians are thus numbered
among the "practitioners of false arts";
and, of the classics upon which they rely so heavily,
"a goodly half is deviant" (line 248).

According to the _Laozi_,
the reason that Confucian morality does not work
is as much a linguistic (in the Saussurian mode) as a philosophical failure.
Since the existence of a word not only implies
but in fact bears responsibility for creating its opposite,
if an enlightened ruler were to discard the Confucian virtues,
the people would naturally revert to goodness,
for they could then conceive of no other course.[^intro-68]
The _Xiang'er_ commentator follows the _Laozi_ only part way in this concern.
Glossing one of the key phrases in the attack of the _Laozi_
on Confucianism---"When the Great Dao was discarded,
humaneness and responsibility came into being"---the commentary admits:

> In high antiquity, when the Dao was employed ... all
were of the same type so that the benevolent and dutiful
were not distinguished from others.
Today the Dao is not employed and people are all flawed.
When occasionally there is a single person who is dutiful,
that person is praised by all in contradistinction to others. (lines 243~46)

But, as we noticed earlier, the _Xiang'er_ commentary
is directed to a wider audience, not to the sage-ruler
who might with impunity keep the populace in ignorance,
as is advocated in the _Laozi_.
At each point where the _Laozi_ suggests that knowledge be discarded
and the people kept in ignorance,
the _Xiang'er_ glosses the phrase in question
to the effect that deviant knowledge should be discarded
and that people should be kept in ignorance of deviant texts---Confucian
texts primary among them.[^intro-69]
Rather than following the _Laozi_ in criticizing the Confucian solution
because it is better that the populace be kept in a natural state of ignorance, 
the _Xiang'er_ develops a truly religious alternative.

According to the _Xiang'er_,
Confucian morality fails because its practitioners are not sincere.
From the common people up to the highest ministers of state,
morality is pursued only in hope of earthly reward and societal acclaim.
Even self-proclaimed sages merely "measure themselves by chapter and verse"
in pursuit of personal aggrandizement,
ignoring the primary teaching duties of sagehood.
Common people, seeing those who are only outwardly moral rewarded,
imitate them.
The result is that

> [s]ons do not care to support their fathers;
people have no thought for their fields.
They only pursue deviant learning,
lining up outside the doors of deviant masters.
They exhaust all of their energies chanting flawed teachings,
even to the end of their days.
Finding that they are unable to move heaven
through sincere practice of loyalty and filiality;
that, though they attempt to regulate their bodies,
they are unable to reach the longevity of Transcendents;
and that, though they try to aid their lord,
they are unable to bring about Great Peace---still
the people employ these unproductive teachings unceasingly,
even to the point that the capitals and cities are deserted. (lines 273-76)

The alternative to this sad state of affairs is a religious morality
based not on human desire for wealth and acclaim
but on fear and respect of heaven.
One of the passages in which this solution is propounded,
though lengthy, deserves to be cited here.
Commenting on the _Laozi_ passage that the ruler ought to
"eliminate humaneness, discard responsibility,
and the people will return to filiality and benevolence,"
the _Xiang'er_ sets the conditions of that "return" as follows:

> When the kingdom is ruled in a manner patterned on the Dao
and when those of humanity and responsibility in the world are employed,
there is no need for force or reward.
This is because people will become humane and responsible
once their moral transformation is valued
and the mind of the Dao is fully open to all.
Those who are sincere by themselves will naturally be rewarded by heaven,
and those who are not will naturally be punished by heaven.
Heaven's scrutiny is even more thoroughgoing than any human being's.
It knows fully who reveres the Dao and fears heaven.
All humaneness and duty will thus be sincere.

> Nowadays kings rule through force and reward,
so the people no longer give allegiance to Heaven....
Mortal scrutiny of good and evil deeds is just not thorough enough.
But if human rewards were discontinued,
all would revert to benevolence and filiality on their own.
The reason for so doing runs counter to the common sense
of the ordinary person, but after a long time
they will come to understand and will join with the Dao.
The ruler of humanity should be fully cognizant of this. (lines 277-86)

It is out of fear or awe of omniscient Heaven on the one hand
and reverence for the Dao on the other that people will act morally.
"Heaven," in this case, is not the supreme moral force of Confucian thought,
but a celestial bureaucracy perfectly modeled on the Dao.[^intro-70]
Heaven's means of oversight is through celestial officers
who tally the good deeds and transgressions of humans in their books of life.
According to the _Xiang'er_, the tallies of the right
are reserved for those outside the Dao, who are destined for death,
whereas the tallies of the left, the tallies of life,
belong to those who keep the precepts of the Dao.[^intro-71]
The unit by which transgressions are recorded
on these tallies is the "count."
A serious transgression results in the deduction of three thousand counts.
According to later texts, each count equals a certain number of days,
from one to ten,
to be subtracted from the transgressor's life span.[^intro-72]
The _Xiang'er_ assures us not only that Heaven's scrutiny
far surpasses that of any human ruler,
but that the people will even perform good in secret,
out of the fear that if their rulers and masters were to reward them,
they would be deprived of Heaven's reward---the "longevity of Transcendents"
(lines 257-59).

Although it excoriates contemporary, mainstream Confucian ethics,
the system of religious morality proposed here
is equally reliant on human desire
and on its own version of "reward and punishment."[^intro-73]
How then does it deal with the _Laozi_'s injunction
that the people should be "without desire"?
Once again, the _Xiang'er_ commentator is careful to distinguish
between the deviant and the correct.
The _Laozi_ requirement that the ruler cause the people to be without desire
is glossed to the effect that
people should not "covet precious goods" (lines to-11).
Number seven of the "Nine Practices" enjoins one only
to "practice desirelessness," but this requirement is clearly mediated
by numbers five, eleven, twelve, fourteen, seventeen, and nineteen
of the _Xiang'er_ precepts, which mandate against what the text considers
"deviant" or human desires for wealth, position, worldly glory, and the like.
As the commentary, borrowing some of the poetry of the _Laozi_, puts it:

> You should have no other concerns;
only trust in the Dao should be found in the broad emptiness of your heart.
Your aspiration should be like that of ice in the valley,
which desires only to flow east and return to the great sea. (lines 195-97)

Despite its thoroughgoing emphasis on the moral and religious education
of the populace, the _Xiang'er_ commentary does present itself
as a supplement to the _Laozi_ in its role as a treatise
on the art of governance.
At points in the commentary, the ruler is addressed directly,
in such phrases as "if now you wish to return to [the practice of the Dao],
it is urgently important that the thearchical ruler
wholeheartedly place his trust in the precepts of the Dao."[^intro-74]
The ruler proves, as we should expect,
key to the establishment of an era of Great Peace on the model of the Dao,
for "the transformative influence of the Dao proceeds down from the top....
If the king's governance is patterned on the Dao,
the officers and populace---even the lowly and the evil---will all
convert to the Dao.[^intro-75]

The commentary distinguishes three sorts of rulers.
First is the "lord of great sageliness,"
who fully makes the Dao his master and thereby brings about
the auspicious omens of Great Peace.
Second is the "lord of middling worthiness,"
who employs worthy Daoist ministers.
The text warns, though, that should this lord's ministers depart one morning,
the kingdom will be in danger of toppling by evening.
Finally, almost beneath mention, is the ruler who transgresses the Dao,
even "belittling the perfected texts in the belief
that [people] will persist in following him."
Such a ruler brings upon himself and his kingdom
not only social disorder, but plague and demonic infestation.[^intro-76]
Beyond the _Xiang'er_'s strict requirement that the ruler adopt,
if not practice himself, the "correct law" of the Dao,
its concept of kingship proves fully consonant with Han ideas of the thearch,
especially as developed in the "weft texts,"
prognostic texts represented as appendices to the Confucian classics.
The surviving passages that make this debt plain
describe how the "essences of the Five Thearchs,"
each associated with one of the five phases,
give birth in turn to the founder of the dynastic house
that is destined to rule.
When this occurs, the name of the new thearch is augured forth
by the Yellow River Chart and the Luo River writings,
and blazoned in the very stars of heaven.[^intro-77]
All of these prodigies are described in the weft texts,
which further relate that the ancient thearchs were engendered
by the miraculous impregnation of their mothers by divine "essence."[^intro-78]

The _Xiang'er_ recommendations for the ruler accord
perfectly with the way in which Zhang Lu actually conducted himself
during his regency in Hanzhong.
What we know from historical sources of his benevolent rule,
his avoidance of armed conflict, and his final surrender to Cao Cao
all find warrant in the commentary.[^intro-79]
It is likely that in Cao Cao,
Zhang felt he had found a lord of at least "middling worthiness."

Beyond such suggestive details, however,
there is in the _Xiang'er_ commentary only indirect testimony
to the practices that so impressed secular historians.
As mentioned earlier, the "chamber of quietness"
is likely related to the meditation practices
subsumed under the designation "the practice of clarity and stillness."
Confession is not specifically mentioned in the commentary,
at least not under the terminology employed by the historians.
We do, however, find frequent reference to the fact that
illness is the result of deviance
and that adepts need to contemplate all of their actions
to ensure that they do not transgress the precepts of the Dao.[^intro-80]
The "documents" to be addressed on behalf of transgressors
to the Three Offices are not mentioned either,
but a possible justification for such petitions is found in the text:
the Office of Heaven records transgressions in one's book of life,
and the Office of Earth is in charge of the unfortunate dead.

Secular historians further mention that, under Zhang Lu's rule,
lawbreakers were forgiven three times before punishment was applied.
A suggestive reference in the section on warfare
that might be related to this practice
urges that the Celestial Master faithful,
when compelled to engage in warfare,
should first "proclaim thrice the five commands,
indicating to [their enemies] the precepts of the Dao
and [their] willingness to receive their submission."[^intro-81]
The same practice is mentioned by Lu Xiujing (406-477),
who notes that, as part of the thrice yearly assemblies,
the master should "correct the name rosters
and make a triple announcement of the five commands
so that the people know the law [of the Dao]."[^intro-82]
Apparently then, the practice was not military
and likely was employed for those who violated the statutes as well.

Finally, though, such "lacunae" should not bother us overly much.
As the items just discussed indicate, the historians
seem to have expressed Celestial Master doctrines in their own words
(substituting, for instance, *gui*, "revenants,"
for what our text forthrightly calls *shi*, "corpses"),
and at any rate, over half of the commentary is missing.

In sum, the moral universe of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
begins and ends with the concern of the Dao for its people.
There is, to be sure, more than a hint of paternalism.
As in Confucianism, the commoners are to be swayed
by the example of their betters, whose moral influence
moves them "like a wind through the slender grasses."
But in this text the status to which they might finally aspire
is the highest in the land, that of sage or even, after death,
"transcendent nobility."
Such a promise could not be held out by Confucianism,
with its stricter models of status relationships,
nor convincingly by Buddhism, in that it lacked the bureaucratic impulse.
Even Daoism, as it came to be accepted in gentry circles,
moved away from the extreme promises we find here.
Recognition of this fact renders all the more poignant
the anguished exhortations of later authors,
who wrote when this ideal system was finally unraveling.
And it makes all the more valuable the witness of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
to what was, in fact, a unique event in Chinese history.

## The Authorship and Date of the _Xiang'er_ Commentary

The sole surviving fragment of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
was discovered among the documents obtained
from the Buddhist grottoes at Dunhuang
and brought back to London by Sir Aurel Stein
in the early twentieth century.
Numbered S 6825, the manuscript contains text and commentary
on only the first half of the _Laozi_ text.
The opening is also torn and missing.
The commentary covers part of what is designated chapter 3
through the end of chapter 37 in standard, received editions of the _Laozi_.
At the end of the manuscript, a colophon states simply,
"_Laozi, Scripture of the Dao_, upper chapter, _Xiang'er_."
From this it is clear that there was also a _Xiang'er_ commentary
to the lower, or "De," portion of the _Laozi_,
a fact confirmed by bibliographic references to the text.[^intro-83]

Experts in analyzing the calligraphy and paper of Dunhuang documents
judge that the _Xiang'er_ manuscript dates to roughly the late fifth
or early sixth century.[^intro-84]
To date, no one has detected the presence of "avoidance characters"
that might help to ascertain with more precision
just when the manuscript was copied.
The commentary is interlinear, but layed out in an archaic style.
There are no breaks between commentary and the text,
and both are written in characters of uniform size.[^intro-85]
Neither is the text divided into *zhang* or chapters,
a significant fact that we shall return to in a moment.
Bibliographic references to the _Xiang'er_,
where they cite an author at all,
uniformly attribute authorship either to Zhang Daoling
or to his grandson, Zhang Lu.[^intro-86]

Ōfuchi Ninji, in his thoroughgoing analysis of the text,
has determined that the _Xiang'er_ commentary
is not to the received editions of the _Laozi_,
but to the so-called Five Thousand Character version of the text,
which has long been thought to have originated with the Daoist religion.
He has discovered that the _Xiang'er_ version of the _Laozi_
is closest to that of the "Ge edition" of the text,
the "Five Thousand Character" edition that appears with a preface
attributed to Ge Xuan (fl. ca. 200 C.E.).
Although the "Ge edition," unlike the _Xiang'er_,
is normally divided into chapters,
a number of manuscript copies from Dunhuang
end with a colophon giving the actual number of characters as 4,999
and explaining that the text was
"established by the lineally descended Master
[Zhang Lu's title in Daoist texts]
and divided into chapters according to
the Perfected Heshang's [version of the text].[^intro-87]
Such findings on the _Laozi_ text annotated in the _Xiang'er_ manuscript
indicate that it is authentically early, but are of little help
with the question of the authorship of the commentary.

Given the paucity of information on the _Xiang'er_ commentary
in later texts and our lack of documentation
on the early history of the Celestial Masters,
it will likely remain impossible to prove with certainty
that Zhang Lu was the author of the text.
Nonetheless, evidence offered by Rao Zongyi and Ōfuchi Ninji
lends credence to the earliest references to the commentary,
which credit Zhang Lu with authorship.
Lacking compelling evidence to the contrary,
there is no reason to discount the witness of the early sources
they have gathered.[^intro-88]

Ōfuchi's researches on the precepts based on the _Xiang'er_ commentary
and cited in other early works further demonstrate that,
if the commentary is not in fact the work of Zhang Lu,
it at any rate dates from the early Celestial Master movement.[^intro-89]
Indeed, it appears from Ōfuchi's findings
that the precepts came to eclipse the commentary from which they were derived.
As the Heshang Gong commentary grew in importance in Daoist circles
and as the doctrines expressed in the _Xiang'er_ were developed in later texts, 
the commentary itself began to appear dated.
Eventually it came to be regarded as little more
than an archaic textual talisman, possessed only by Daoist
"Masters of the Doctrine" of the higher order.[^intro-90]

Further, and again following the lead of Chen Shixiang,
Ōfuchi points to evidence that allows us to be even more accurate
in dating the commentary.
The _Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao_,
another early Celestial Master text,
one written in the voice of a Celestial Master in 255 C.E.,
betrays ideas very similar to those of the _Xiang'er_,
contains the words "*xiang er*," and cites precisely one
of the _Xiang'er_ precepts.[^intro-91]
My own study of the _Admonitions_ has turned up at least six further points
at which it depends for its logic, if not its wording,
on the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
The most compelling of these is the flurry of citations from the _Laozi_,
all of which rely on the understandings of the _Xiang'er_ commentary,
that appear at the end of the text.
A brief citation from this portion of the _Admonitions_
will serve to illustrate this point:

> The Dao conceals itself and is nameless.
Name is an axe that hacks at the body.
"Good actions leave no trace."
If they wish to make it so that others do not see their "traces,"
those who practice the Dao should regulate their bodies
and nurture their lives to seek blessing.
Instead of which you teach others to give free rein to the self.
If the self is given free rein, people will see its traces.[^intro-92]

The locution "X is an axe that hacks away at the body"
occurs at _Xiang'er_, line 350, where it is applied to evil in general.
More telling, the _Laozi_ passage cited in the _Admonitions_ extract
is glossed by all other commentators of whom I am aware
as meaning "one good at traveling leaves no traces."[^intro-93]
Given its parallelism with lines such as
"one good at calculations does not use counting sticks"
and "one good at tying, ties without using ropes or knots,
yet it cannot be untied,"
this is likely the best explanation of the _Laozi_ passage.
The _Xiang'er_ commentary alone takes *shan*, "good," in a moral sense:
"When one keeps faith with the Dao and practices good,
there is no trace of evil" (line 405),
obviously reading the line as I have translated it
in the _Admonitions_ extract.[^intro-94]
This is the understanding of the _Admonitions_ author as well,
since he states that "if the self is given free rein,
people will see its traces."
It is almost certain, then, that the author of the _Admonitions_
is following the _Xiang'er_ explanation of the line.

The remaining allusions to the _Xiang'er_ commentary
are mentioned in the footnotes to the translation
of the _Admonitions_ in this book.
Since the _Admonitions_ gives the date of its circulation
to all of the Daoist faithful, we have an extremely accurate
*terminus ad quem* for the composition
of the _Xiang'er_ commentary---1 February 255.

As Ōfuchi notes, however, it is likely that the commentary
was composed for a stable Daoist community,
one (as we will see) searching for a worthy monarch
to adopt its ideas of governance.
All of these conditions best fit the Hanzhong community
and point to Zhang Lu as the most likely author.

One remaining mystery is the meaning of the title of the commentary.
Several hypotheses have been offered.
Chen Shixiang speculates that the name
may have something to do with *cunxiang*, the visualization of deities.
Both Rao and Ōfuchi cite later scriptures containing the two graphs
*xiang* and *er* in contexts where they mean either
that celestial deities "think of you"
or that adepts should "*contemplate* them"
and they will bring peace to "*you*."[^intro-95]
Indeed, the most common meaning of the two graphs *xiang* and *er*
is "thinking of (or contemplating) you."
It seems most likely that this simple explanation is the best one.
The _Admonitions_ contains two phrases that,
though using only proximate wording, express this very idea:

> If you keep your mind fixed on the Dao,
the Dao will keep you in mind;
if you do not,
the Dao will not be mindful of you.

> If you cherish life and practice the Dao
with your thoughts on the True and Correct,
the Dao will cherish you.
If you do not remain mindful of the Dao,
the Dao will distance itself from you.[^intro-96]

The _Xiang'er_ commentary also emphasizes this idea throughout.
Several examples follow:

> Those who keep the precepts and do not transgress them
have maintained Unity.
Those who do not practice the precepts will lose this Unity. (line 111)

> Whenever human beings wish to undertake some action,
they should first gauge it against the precepts of the Dao,
considering it calmly to determine that the principles of their action
do not contravene the Dao.
Only then should they gradually pursue it,
so that the Dao of life does not depart from them. (line 206)

> If people do not hold in awe the precepts of the Dao in all things
and miss the intentions of the Dao, the Dao will depart from them. (line 365)

It seems from this that the phrase
"If you think of the Dao, the Dao will think of you"
was a slogan of the early Celestial Masters.
It would make sense, then, that the commentary might be styled
"[the Dao] thinks of you," as Ōfuchi has in fact suggested.
Due to the somewhat ridiculous prospect of writing throughout
of the "Thinking of You" commentary
as much as to the hypothetical nature of this conclusion,
I have left the term untranslated here.

## Structure and Conventions of the Translation

Like the Mawangdui editions of the _Laozi_,
the edition presented in the _Xiang'er_ manuscript
is not divided into chapters.
There is evidence to support the notion
that the Heshang Gong edition of the text,
which is known in early bibliographies as
the "Heshang Gong _Laozi_ [divided into] chapters and verses,"
was the earliest to be so divided.[^intro-97]
But whether it was or not, it is clear that the division into chapters
is an act of interpretation,
especially given the reading conventions of classical Chinese,
where, for instance, when sentence subjects are omitted
one routinely assumes that the last-mentioned subject
is the subject of succeeding sentences as well.
In an attempt to preserve insofar as possible
the structure and flow of the original text,
I have thus decided not to insert, even in parentheses,
any reference to the chapter divisions of other editions.

This decision has created some problems,
especially in that Rao Zongyi,
whose edition of the text is otherwise quite useful and readily accessible,
and Mugitani Kuniō, who has produced a concordance to
and accompanying transcription of the manuscript,
have both decided to follow the chapter divisions of the received editions.
The translation given here, then, will of necessity refer by line number
to the photographic copy of S 6825 reproduced in Ōfuchi Ninji's
_Tonkō dōkyō mokurokuhen_.[^intro-98]
For the benefit of those who wish to compare
this translation with other translations or editions of the _Laozi_,
I have provided a "Key to Chapter Numbers" matching the chapter divisions
of the received text to the line numbers of the _Xiang'er_ text;
see table 3.

In Ōfuchi's reproduction, the lines are counted off by fives.
I have followed the same procedure,
marking in the margins of the translation the English line
in which every fifth line of Chinese text begins.
Of course the line numbers of my translation
will not precisely match those of the Chinese text,
but the reader should be able to find the text to which I refer
without too much difficulty.

-------------------------------------------------

Table: Table 3. Key to chapter numbers in the _Laozi_

There were three mistakes made
by whoever originally counted the lines of the Chinese text.
These are as follows:

1. The fourth line after line 90,
which ends a page of the reproduction,
is counted as 99 instead of 94.
1. Line 320 is counted twice,
so that what should be line 325 appears as a second 320.
1. What should be line 395 is instead marked 400.

In his reproduction, Ōfuchi marks each of these mistakes with an asterisk.
I have seen no reason to follow suit in this.
Since my numbering serves only as a reference to the Chinese text
and missing lines will obviously not be referred to
in my analysis of the text, the first and third mistakes
have no consequences here.
I have, however, marked the second instance of line 320
with the small letter *a* and will refer to it and the following four lines
as 320a, 321a, and so forth.

In translating the _Xiang'er_ commentary,
it was unavoidable that I also translate portions of the _Laozi_,
something that had been done so many times before
that it was difficult to look at the text with fresh eyes.
Nonetheless, I have made every effort to remain uninfluenced
by any of the numerous translations of the work
and have striven to translate it as the commentary seemed to direct
that I understand each line.
This is an enterprise fraught with peril, I know,
not only because my translation of the _Laozi_
then depends entirely on my understanding of the commentary,
but also because the _Xiang'er_ commentator
seems more interested in drawing specific lessons from the _Laozi_
than in explicating its meaning.
Because of this concern, he may, for instance,
explicate only a single phrase from the _Laozi_ and go on to discuss that,
leaving the rest of the sentence alone.
What he might have made of the sentence itself,
in such cases, is anyone's guess.
Despite such pitfalls, I have decided on this treacherous course
in the conviction that my focus here is really not on the _Laozi_
but on what early Daoists made of it.
It therefore seemed preferable to try to fathom that understanding
using all available means rather than begin with received understandings
of the _Laozi_ and then try to determine how the _Xiang'er_ commentary
differed from them.

It has accordingly not been my goal to compare any other commentary
with that of the _Xiang'er_.
Where the _Xiang'er_ commentator
is manifestly imposing meaning on the _Laozi_,
as for instance when he finds the surname of Confucius in the text,
I have mentioned that fact in notes.[^intro-99]
References to other editions of the _Laozi_ are meant in the same way:
I give them only when they seem to me to throw some light
on the goals of the _Xiang'er_ commentator.
(Readers should be aware that I have not attempted
a thorough comparison of the _Xiang'er_ version of the _Laozi_
with other editions.)

Although I think that they were likely written at about the same time,
it is likewise not my intention to engage in the debate
over the relative dates of the Heshang Gong and the _Xiang'er_.
Such comparisons of necessity focus on isolated passages and ideas,
and I think it vital, at this stage of our researches into Daoism,
that the _Xiang'er_ be presented as a whole and that its ideas,
and the relative weight accorded each, be presented to the reader.
This introduction functions to highlight those aspects of the text
that seem to me to be most important
to the development of the Daoist religion,
though future commentators will doubtless want to focus on other features.
The translation presented here is intended to assist
this next step in our understanding of the early Celestial Masters.
The _Xiang'er_ commentary itself has words of advice
for those who would interpret it:

> The aspects of the Dao that might be separately examined
are so many that there is not enough bamboo and silk to write of them all.
Consequently, we go back to its reversion to the One.
What would be the harm in analyzing one of its many aspects?
The Dao may not be analyzed because, by doing this,
we falsify its simplicity, lose its undifferentiation,
and diffuse it to the extent that it is one with the deviant. (lines 170-72)

Clearly, in trying to analyze the text at all
I have placed myself firmly among the deviates.
