# Chapter 10

載營魄抱一
能無離
Carry and manage your whitesouls. Through embracing Unity,
you will be able to keep them from separating.[^xianger-18]

> 魄
白也
The whitesouls
are white in color.
故精白與元同色
For this reason, essence [i.e., semen] is white, the same color as primal pneuma.
身為精車
精落故當載營之
The body is the vehicle of the essence,
and, since essence tends to fall from it, you should carry and manage it.
神成氣來
載營人身
When the [internal] spirits are formed,
pneumas come to carry and manage the human body.
欲全此功
無離一
If you wish to complete this task,
do not depart from the One.
一者
道也
The One
is the Dao.

> 今在人身何許
Now, where does the Dao reside in the body of a person?
守之云[^rse-10-1]何
How can a person hold it fast?
一不在人身也
諸附身者
悉世間常偽伎
The One does not reside within the human body.
Those who say that it entrusts itself to the body
are the same ones who are forever practicing false arts in the mortal world.
非真道也
Theirs is not the true Dao.
一在天地外
The One exists beyond heaven and earth.
人在天地間
但往來人身中耳
Entering into the space between heaven and earth,
it comes and goes within the human body;
都皮裏悉是
非獨一處
that's all.
It is there everywhere within your skin,
not just in a single spot.
一散形為氣
聚形為太上老君
常治崑崙[^rse-10-2]
The One disperses its form as pneuma
and gathers in its form as the Most High Lord Lao,
whose permanent rule is on Mount Kunlun.
或言虛無
或言自然
或言無名
皆同一耳
What is sometimes called "void nothingness,"
sometimes the "self-actualizing,"
sometimes "the nameless,"
are all alike the One.
今布道誡
教人守誡不違
即為守一矣
Now that the precepts of the Dao
are spread abroad to instruct people, those who keep the precepts and do not transgress them
have maintained Unity.[^xianger-19]
不行其誡
即為失一也
Those who do not practice the precepts
will lose this Unity.

> 世間常偽伎
指五藏以名一
Those who forever practice false arts in the mortal world
point to [one of the] five viscera and call it "the One."[^10-1]
瞑目思想
欲從求福
They close their eyes and practice meditation,
hoping by these means to seek good fortune.
非也
This is wrong.
去生遂遠矣
They depart ever further from life in so doing.

專氣致柔
能嬰兒
Concentrate the pneumas, achieve suppleness,
and you can become as a newborn babe.

> 嬰兒無為
故合道
The newborn does not act willfully [*wu wei*]
and is thus joined with the Dao.[^10-2]
但不知自製[^rse-10-3]
This is simply because infants are unaware of self-control.
知稍生
故致老
But their knowledge gradually increases
and so they eventually reach old age.
謂欲為柔致氣
法兒小時
This passage means that if you wish to become supple and bring pneumas into your body,
you should model yourself on the young child.

滌除玄覽
能無疵
Cleanse and purify your mysterious and expansive gaze
and you will be able to achieve flawlessness.

> 人身像天地
The human body reflects the image of heaven and earth.
覽
廣也
*Lan*
means "expanse."[^xianger-20]
疵
惡也
非道所熹
"Flaws"
are evil deeds,
those things in which the Dao is not pleased.
當滌除一身
行必令無惡也
You should cleanse and purify your whole body
and, in your actions, ensure that you do no evil.

愛民治國而無知
As you cherish the masses and regulate the kingdom, let there be no knowledge.

> 人君欲愛民令壽考
治國令太平
當精心鑿道意
The lord of the people, desiring to cherish the masses so as to cause their longevity
and to regulate the kingdom so as to bring about Great Peace,
should earnestly plumb the intentions of the Dao.
教民皆令知道真
無令知偽道耶知也
In teaching the masses, he should cause them to know the perfection of the Dao
and not allow them to know of false ways or deviant doctrines.

明白四達而無為
As awareness reaches the four quarters, let there be no false action [*wu wei*].

> 上士心通
自多所知
Those of higher attainment have open minds
and naturally increase their knowledge.
知惡而棄
Knowing evil, they discard it;
知善能行
knowing good, they are able to practice it.
勿敢為惡事也
They dare not perform evil.[^10-3]

天地開闔而為雌
As heaven and earth open and close, act the feminine.

> 男女陰陽孔也
Male and female have yang and yin orifices.
男當法地似女
前章已說矣
Males should pattern themselves on earth and be like females,
as I have explained in a previous paragraph.[^10-4]

生之畜之
It gives birth to them and nurtures them.
生而不有
Giving birth, it yet does not possess.
為而不恃
Acting, it does not rely [on anything else].
長而不宰
Extending, it does not divide [spheres of influence].
是謂玄德
This is called the power of the mysterious.

> 玄
天也
常法道行如此
The "mysterious"
is heaven,
which eternally patterns itself on the Dao and moves in these ways.
欲令人法也
\[The Dao\] desires people to pattern themselves on heaven.
