# Chapter 28

知其雄
守其雌
為天下奚
Knowing the male
yet preserving the female
is essential for all under heaven.

> 欲令雄如雌
You should make the male as the female.[^xianger-46]
奚
何也
亦近要也
知要安精神
即得天下之要
If you know the essential
and keep still your essence and spirits,
you will achieve the essential here below heaven.

常德不離
Constant power does not depart;
復歸於嬰兒
it returns again to the newborn child.

> 專精無為
道德常不離之
Those who concentrate their essences and do not act willfully
will never be forsaken by the powers of the Dao.
更反為嬰兒
They will become newborn again.

知其白
守其黑
為天下式
Knowing the white
yet preserving within the black
is the model for all under heaven.

> 精白與元炁同色
The essence is white. It is the same color as primal pneuma.[^28-1] [^xianger-47]
黑太陰中也
Black is the color within the Palace of Grand Darkness.
於人在腎
精藏之
Within the human, this is the *shen* [i.e., urogenital organs],
where the essence is stored.
安如不用為守黑
Leaving [the essence] unmoved and not employing it is to "preserve within the black."[^xianger-48]
天下常法式也
This is the constant method for all under heaven.

常德不貸
Enduring power may not be borrowed.
復歸於無極
It returns again to the illimitable. 

> 知守黑者
道德常在
Those who know how to preserve within the black
have the power of the Dao ever resident within them.
不從人貸
必當償之
不如自有也
They do not "borrow" from others,
since needing to have it given to you
is not so good as keeping it by yourself.
行玄女經
龔子
容成之法
悉欲貸
Those who practice the Classic of the Dark Woman
and the methods of Gongzi
and Rongcheng
all wish to borrow.[^28-2]
何人主當貸若者乎
But what creditor exists who will loan?
故令不得也
So they receive nothing.
唯有自守
絕心閉念者
大無極也
Only those who preserve their own supply of essence
and who cut off their desires
are great without limit.

知其榮
守其辱
為天下谷
Those who know the possibility of glory
yet preserve their debasement
are the world's valleys.

> 有榮必有辱
If there is glory there must be disgrace.
道人畏辱
故不貪榮
Daoists fear disgrace
and so do not covet glory.
但歸志於道
唯願長生
如天下谷水之欲東流歸於海也
They merely submit their aspirations to the Dao,
desiring only long life,
just like the water in valleys throughout the world flows eastward to return to the sea.

為天下谷
常德乃足
復歸於樸
If you are a valley in the world,
your enduring power is sufficient
and you will revert to the state of unworked wood [i.e., simplicity].

> 志道當如谷水之志欲歸海
Your aspiration toward the Dao should be like that of the water in the valleys, which flows eastward to the sea.
道德常足
Then the power of the Dao will always be sufficient.
樸
道本氣也
"Unworked wood"
refers to the original pneumas of the Dao.
人行道歸樸
與道合
When people practice the Dao and revert to this state,
they join with the Dao.

樸散為器
Unworked wood is broken up to make implements.
聖人用為官長
The Sage employs those with simplicity to serve as officials and elders.

> 為器以離道矣
"To make implements" one must depart from the Dao.
不當令樸散也
You should not allow those with simplicity to be broken up [or scattered].
聖人能不散之
The Sage is able to accomplish this.
故官長治人
能致太平
In this way, the Sage's officials and elders might rule over the people
and bring about Great Peace.

是以大制無割
This is why the greatest order does not require carving.

> 道人同知俗事
高官
重祿
好衣
美食
珍寶之味耳
皆不能致長生
The people of the Dao all know that a taste for mundane
things---high official position,
rich emoluments,
good clothes,
fine foods,
and precious baubles---will
not bring long life.
長生為大福
Long life is a great blessing.
為道人欲制大
故自忍不以俗事割心情也
To be a person of the Dao is to desire to control what is great
and so to forebear, not allowing these mundane things to carve away at one's will and emotions.
