# Chapter 31

夫佳兵者
不祥之器
Now, excellent arms
are unpropitious implements.
物或惡之
\[Living\] beings are deceived by[^xianger-54] them and detest them;
有道不處
thus those who possess the Dao do not remain there.

> 兵者非道所憙
有道者不處之
Weapons are not things in which the Dao delights,
so those who possess the Dao do not remain by them.

君子居則貴左
The gentleman who remains at peace values the left.
用兵則貴右
Those who employ weapons value the right.

> 左右契也
"Left" and "right" refer to the tallies.[^31-1]

兵者不祥器
Weapons are unpropitious implements;
非君子之器
they are not the tools of the gentleman.

> 重明其凶[^rse-31-1]事也
This further clarifies their unpropitious nature.

不得已而用之
Employ them only when there is no choice.

> 前章已說之也
This was explained previously.

恬淡為上
Tranquillity and emotionlessness are best.
故不美
Therefore, do not praise weapons.

> 道人恬淡
Daoists are tranquil and emotionless.
不美兵也
They do not praise weaponry.

若美必樂之
是煞人
Those who praise them certainly take delight in them,
and this is murder.
夫樂煞者
不可得意於天下
Those who delight in murder
will not realize their goals in the world.

> 明樂兵樂煞不可也
It is not permissible to understand and delight in weapons or to delight in killing.

故吉事尚左
Therefore, matters of good fortune are exalted on the left;
喪事尚右
matters of mourning are exalted on the right.[^xianger-55]

> 左右契也
"Left" and "right" refer to the tallies.

是以偏將軍居左
This is why the lieutenant general occupies the left;
上將軍居右
the major general occupies the right.

> 偏將軍不專煞生之機
像左
The lieutenant general does not specialize in the taking of life
and so is patterned on the left.
上將軍專煞
像右
The major general! specializes in killing
and so is patterned on the right.[^31-2]

言以喪禮處之
Which is to say, they are positioned as at a funeral ceremony.
煞人眾多
以悲哀泣之
When many are killed,
mourn and weep for them.
戰勝以喪禮處之
When there is victory in battle, arrange them as at a funeral ceremony.

> 不得已而有者
輒三申五令
示以道誡
願受其降
When there is no recourse and war is unavoidable,
you should always proclaim thrice the five commands,
indicating to [your enemies] the precepts of the Dao
and your willingness to receive their submission.[^31-3]
不從者當閔傷悲泣之
如家有喪
If they do not submit, you should be compassionate toward them, mourn for them, and weep
as if there were a loss in your own family.
勿喜快也
Do not rejoice [at victory].
