# Chapter 18

大道廢
有仁義
When the great Dao was discarded, humaneness and responsibility came into being.

> 上古道用時
以人為名
皆行仁義
In high antiquity,
when the Dao was employed,
all people were humane and responsible.[^18-1]
同相像類
仁義不別
All were of the same type
so that the benevolent and dutiful were not distinguished from others.
今道不用
人悉弊薄
Today the Dao is not employed
and people are all flawed.
時有一人行義
便共表別之
When occasionally there is a single person who is dutiful,
that person is praised by all in contradistinction to others.
故言有也
This is why it says, "Humaneness and responsibility came into being."

智慧出
有大偽
When wisdom emerged,
falseness came into being.

> 真道藏
耶文出
When the true Dao is hidden away,
deviant writings emerge.
世間常偽伎稱道教
皆為大偽不可用
Those mortals who commonly practice false arts proclaim them as the teachings of the Dao,
but it is all fraud and may not be employed.
何謂耶文
What are these deviant writings?
其五經半入耶
Of the five scriptures, a goodly half is deviant.[^18-2]
其五經以外
眾書傳記
屍人所作悉耶耳
Beyond the five scriptures,
all of the writings, biographies, and records
are the creations of corpses. These are completely deviant.

六親不和
有孝慈
When the six sorts of relationship became inharmonious,
filiality and benevolence came into being.[^18-3]

> 道用時
家家慈孝
When the Dao was employed,
every family was filial and benevolent.
皆同相類
慈孝不別
All people were of the same type,
so the benevolent and filial were not singled out.
今道不用
Today the Dao is not employed.
人不慈孝
六親不和
People are not benevolent and filial,
so the six relations are inharmonious.
時有一人行慈孝
便共表別之
When occasionally there is a single person who is benevolent or filial,
that person is praised by all in contradistinction to others.
故言有也
This is why it says, "Filiality and benevolence came into being."

國家昏亂
有忠臣
When the kingdom was thrown into confusion, the loyal minister came into being.

> 道用時
帝王躬奉行之
When the Dao was employed,
the Thearchs and princes personally revered and practiced it.
練明其意以臣庶
Through constantly refining their understanding of the Dao's intentions, they made themselves subservient to the Dao.
於此吏民莫不效[^rse-18-1]法者
None of the officials or subjects failed to pattern themselves on their ruler.
知道意
賤死貴仙
竟行忠孝
Knowing the intentions of the Dao,
they considered death a trifle and valued transcendence,
so that they strove with one another in loyalty and filiality.
質樸愨端
以臣為名
皆忠相類不別
Yet they were simple and sincere in their uprightness,[^xianger-28]
so that those who took the title of minister
were all loyal and of the same type as everyone else, without distinction.
今道不用
Today the Dao is not employed.
臣皆學耶文
習權詐
隨心情
The ministers all study deviant writings
and practice argumentation and deception
to follow the whims of the ruler.
面言善
內懷惡
Though their faces and their words are pleasing,
within they harbor evil.
時有一人行忠誠
便共表別之
When occasionally there is a person who is loyal and sincere,[^xianger-29]
that person is praised by all in contradistinction to others.
故言有也
This is why it says, "[The loyal minister] came into being."

> 道用時
臣忠子孝
國則易治
When the Dao was employed,
ministers were loyal and children filial
so that the kingdom was easily ruled.
時臣子不畏君父也
乃畏天神
At that time ministers and children did not fear their lords or their fathers,
but only the spirits of heaven.
孝其行
不得仙壽
If they did not[^xianger-30] act filially,
they would not obtain the longevity of Transcendents.
故自至誠
Thus they were perfectly sincere in their pursuits.
既為忠孝
不欲令君父知
自默而行
欲蒙天報
When they practiced loyalty and filiality,
they did not want their lords and fathers to know,
so they kept quiet about their actions,
desiring only to receive the recompense of heaven.
設君父知之
必賞以高官
報以意氣
The reason they acted in secret was that, if the lord or their fathers knew,
they would certainly reward the practitioners with high official position
and recompense them with favor.
如此功盡
天福不至
是故默而行之
In this way the merit accrued would be exhausted
and heavenly favor
would not fall on the practitioners.
不欲見功
Thus, they did not wish their merit to be known.
今之臣子
雖忠孝
皆欲以買君父
求功名
Today, though ministers and children
might be loyal or filial,
they all do it in order to barter their acts with the lords and fathers
for merit and fame.
過時不顯異之
便屏恕之
言無所知
If, having performed some deed, that deed is not particularly remarked,
they become privately angry about it
and say, "No one even noticed!"
此類外是內非
無至誠感天之行
Such people are outwardly good, but inwardly evil,
performing no deeds of true sincerity that might move heaven.
故令國難治
Thus, the kingdom is difficult to rule.

> 今欲復此疾
要在帝王當專心信道誡也
If now you wish to return to [the practice of the Dao],
it is urgently important that the thearchical ruler wholeheartedly place his trust in the precepts of the Dao.
