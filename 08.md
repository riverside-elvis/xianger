# Chapter 8

上善若水
The highest goodness is like water.
水善利萬物又不爭
Water excels at benefiting the ten thousand things and, moreover, does not contend.

> 水善能柔弱
The excellence of water is that it is able to remain supple and weak.
像道去高就下
避實歸虛
常潤利萬物
In this it images the Dao.
Moving from high places to low,
it avoids the solid and returns to emptiness,
constantly benefiting the ten thousand things with its moisture.
終不爭
To the end, it does not struggle;
故欲令人法則之也
this is why [the Dao] wishes people to take water as their model.

處眾人之所惡
Positioned in spots the masses of people detest,
it is close to the Dao.
故幾於道

> 水能受垢辱不潔之物
Water is able to receive defiled and impure things;
幾像道也
in this it is closely similar to the Dao.

居善地
For dwelling, it favors the earth;
心善淵
for a stopping place,[^xianger-13] it favors the abyss.

> 水善得窐空
Water excels at seeking out nooks and hollows.
便居止為淵
Then, where it stops, it forms depths.
淵
深也
"Abyss"
here means depths.

與善仁
It provides through goodness and kindness.[^xianger-14]

> 人當法水
心常樂善仁
People should model themselves on water,
constantly delighting in goodness and kindness.

言善信
Speak that which is good and trustworthy;

> 人當常相教為善有誠信
People should constantly instruct one another in goodness and should be trustworthy.

政善治
govern through good rule;

> 人君理國
常當法道為政則致治
When the lord of the people orders his kingdom,
he should always construct his government on the model of the Dao.
By this means he will bring about order.

事善能
serve those with good abilities;

> 人等當欲事師
當求善能知真道者
All people should desire to serve their teacher
and should seek out one with good abilities who knows the true Dao.
不當事耶偽伎巧耶知驕奢也
They should not serve the deviant, the false, or the cunning.
Deviant knowledge is proud and extravagant.

動善時
and move when the time is beneficial.

> 人欲舉動
勿違道誡
When people wish to undertake some affair,
they should not transgress the precepts of the Dao.
不可得傷王氣
They must not injure the ascendant pneumas.[^08-1]

夫唯不爭
故無尤
If one is only able to refrain from contention in these things,
one will meet with nothing extraordinary.

> 唯
獨也
"Only"
means solely.
尤
大也
"Extraordinary"
means great.
人獨能放水不爭
終不遇大害
If people were only able to imitate[^xianger-15] water in lacking contention,
they would never meet with great harm.
