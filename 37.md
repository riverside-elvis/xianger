# Chapter 37

道常無為而無不為
Since the Dao never acts falsely, nothing is left undone.

> 道性不為惡事
The nature of the Dao is such that it does not perform evil deeds.
故能神無所不作
Thus it is spiritual and is creative of all things.
道人當法之
Daoists should take this as their model.[^37-1]

王侯若能守
If the king and lords are able to cling to it,

> 王者雖尊
猶常畏道
奉誡行之
Though the king is venerated,
he still should fear the Dao
and keep the precepts.

萬物將自化
then the myriad beings will transform of themselves.

> 王者法道為政
吏民庶孽子
悉化為道
If the king's governance is patterned on the Dao,
the officers and populace---even the lowly and the evil---will
all convert to the Dao.[^37-2]

化如欲作
吾將鎮之以無名之樸
If this transformative influence is what you wish to put into motion,
I will secure it with nameless simplicity.

> 失正變得耶
When the correct [way] is lost and perverted, deviance results.
耶改得正
When the deviant is transformed, correctness ensues.
今王者法道
民悉從正
Now, if the king patterns himself on the Dao,
the people will all follow the correct way.
齋正而止
不可復變
變為耶矣
You should achieve[^xianger-61] this correctness and stop,
not allowing further change,
since further change leads again to deviance.
觀其將變
道便鎮制之
檢以無名之樸
教誡見也
Seeing that change is about to occur,
the Dao will secure it and control it,
regulating it through nameless simplicity,
which is that appearing in the precepts of the Dao.
王者亦當法道鎮制之
而不能制者
世俗悉變為耶矣
The king should [himself] imitate the Dao in securing and controlling it,
yet he is not able to do so [alone],
since the common practice of the world is to revert to deviance;
下古世是也
at least, in the age of lower antiquity this is so.[^37-3]

無名之樸
亦將不欲
Nameless simplicity
has no desire for anything further.

> 道性於俗間都無所欲
The nature of the Dao in the profane world is to have no desire for anything.
王者亦當法之
The king should also imitate this.

無欲以靜
天地自正
When lack of desire leads to stillness,
heaven and earth set themselves right of their own accord.

> 道常無欲樂清靜
The Dao is ever without desire. It delights in clarity and stillness.
故令天地常正
Thus it makes heaven and earth ever correct.
天地道臣也
Heaven and earth are ministers of the Dao.
王者法道行誡
臣下悉皆自正矣
When the king patterns himself on the Dao and keeps the precepts,
his own ministers and subordinates will all correct themselves.
