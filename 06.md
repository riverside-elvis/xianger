means desire.

當結精自守
If you desire to keep these spirits from perishing,
you should congeal your essences and maintain them.
牝者
地也
The "feminine"
is earth.

therefore [their sexual organs] do not become rigid.

心當像地似女
勿為事先
If a man wishes to congeal his essence
he should mentally pattern himself on earth and be like a woman.
He should not work to give himself priority.[^xianger-6]

The gate of the mysterious feminine
is the root of heaven and earth---

> 牝
地也
The "feminine"
refers to the earth.
女像之
Women are patterned after it.
陰孔為門
死生之官也
The vagina is the "gate,"
the comptroller of life and death.
最要故名根
It is the very crux [of existence] and thus is called "the root."
男荼亦名根
The penis is also called "the root."

綿綿若存
attenuated and so enduring.

> 陰陽之道
以若結精為生
The Dao of yin and yang
is therefore similar to congealing the essences to produce life.[^06-1]
年以知命
當名自止
At the age of fifty, having filled one's [productive] role,
one should stop.[^xianger-7]
年少之時
雖有當閒省之
Even when one is young, though one possesses [the capabilities for reproduction],
one should rest [from intercourse] and preserve [these potencies].
綿綿者
微也
"Attenuated"
means slight.
從其微少
若少年則長存矣
If one from youth follows the path of lessening,
one will endure for a long time.
今此乃為大害
At present, this matter [i.e., sexual intercourse] is the cause of great injury.
道造之何
Why did the Dao create it?
道重繼祠
種類不絕
The Dao places great emphasis on the continuation of ancestral sacrifice
and the survival of the species.
欲令合精產生
故教之年少微省不絕
Desiring humanity to join their essences and so produce life,
the Dao teaches the youthful to preserve their essences but not to cut them off.
不教之勤力也
It does not teach humanity to labor [at intercourse].
勤力之計
出愚人之心耳
This scheme of laboring [at intercourse]
was thought up by the ignorant.[^06-2]
豈可怨道乎
The Dao cannot be held responsible for it.
上德之人
志操堅彊
能不戀結產生
Those of higher virtue
possess iron wills
and are able to stop coupling for the purpose of reproducing.
少時便絕
Thus they cut off the flow [of their essences] when they are young.
又善神早成
Moreover, in this way they are sooner able to form beneficent [internal] spirits.
言此者
道精也
These are called
"essences of the Dao."
故令天地無祠
龍無子
仙人無妻
玉女無夫
This is why heaven and earth lack ancestral shrines,
dragons lack offspring,
Transcendents lack[^xianger-8] wives,
and Jade Maidens lack husbands.[^06-3]
其大信也
This is the highest way of keeping faith with the Dao!

用之不勤
Employ it without belaboring it.

> 能用此道
應得仙壽
If one is able to practice this Dao,
one ought to obtain the longevity of a Transcendent.
男女之事
不可不勤也
But one should absolutely not labor [at intercourse].[^xianger-9]
