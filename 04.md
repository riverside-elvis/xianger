# Chapter 4

道沖而用之不盈
Employ the Dao as it rushes in. Further, do not allow it to overflow.

> 道貴中和
The Dao values the centrally harmonious.[^04-1]
當中和行之
You should practice it in inner harmony.
志意不可盈溢違道誡
Your will should not flood over, for this is a transgression of the precepts of the Dao.[^04-2]

淵似萬物之宗
Be deep, resembling the primogenitor of the myriad things.

> 道也
This refers to the Dao.
人行道不違誡
淵深似道
When one practices the Dao and does not transgress the precepts,
one is deep like the Dao.

挫其銳
Blunt its sharp edges;
解其忿
release its vexations.

> 銳者
心方欲圖惡
The "sharp edge" refers to
the heart as it is plotting evil.
忿者
怒也
"Vexations"
means anger.
皆非道所喜
Both of these are things in which the Dao takes no delight.
心欲為惡
挫還之
When your heart wishes to do evil,
blunt and divert it;
怒欲發寬解之
when anger is about to emerge, forgive and release it.
勿使五藏忿怒也
Do not allow your five viscera to harbor anger and vexation.
自威以道誡
Strictly control yourself by means of the precepts of the Dao;
自勸以長生
urge yourself on with the [hope of] long life.
於此致當
By these means you will reach the desired state.
忿爭激
急弦聲
The stirring of vexations
is like the rapid vibrations of lute strings;
所以者過
this is why it leads to excess.[^04-3]
積死遲怒
傷死以疾
You should strive[^xianger-4] to be slow to anger,
for death and injury result from these violent urges.
五藏以傷
道不能治
If the five viscera are injured by anger,
the Dao is not able to govern.
故道誡之重
教之丁寧
This is why the Dao has issued such heavy injunctions against anger
and why the Dao teaches about it so diligently.

> 五藏所以傷者
皆金木水火土氣不和也
The five viscera are injured when the five pneumas [which fill them]---those of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth---are rendered inharmonious.[^04-4]
和則相生
When these are harmonious, they give birth to one another;
戰則相剋[^rse-04-1]
when they clash, they attack one another.
隨怒事情
輒有所發
When you give vent to anger or follow your emotions,
one of these pneumas will always issue forth.
發一藏則故克所勝
成病煞人
It issues from one of the viscera and then attacks the others.
The victorious pneuma will then form an illness and kill you.
人遇陽者
發囚刻王
怒而無傷
If you are strong in yang,
a declining pneuma will emerge to attack an ascendant pneuma
and there will be no injury from the anger.
雖爾去死如發耳
Even so, in this way you are only a hair's breadth from death.
如人衰者
發王刻囚
禍成矣
If you are weak,
an ascendant pneuma will emerge to attack a declining pneuma
and disaster will result.[^04-5]

和其光
Harmonize your radiances;
同其塵
unify your dust.

> 情性不動
喜怒不發
五藏皆和同相生
When one's emotions are unmoved
and one's joy and anger do not issue forth,
the five viscera harmonize and are mutually productive.
與道同光塵也
This is to be of one radiance and of one dust with the Dao.

湛似常存
Be deep and still and so perpetually present.

> 如此湛然常在不亡
One who is still in this fashion endures perpetually without perishing.

吾不知誰子
Do you not yet know whose child I am?
像帝之先
My image preceded the Thearchs.

> 吾事
道也
帝先者
亦道也
"I"
refers to the Dao,
as does the phrase "preceded the Thearchs."
與無名萬物始同一耳
The ten thousand things all alike originated in it, the nameless.
未知誰家子能行此道
It is not yet known which children from which families will be able to practice this Dao.
能行者便像道也
似帝先矣
Those who are able to practice it will pattern themselves on the Dao
and will be as if they existed before the Thearchs.[^04-6]
