# Chapter 15

古之善為士者
微妙玄通
In ancient times, those who were superior nobles were
subtle and wondrous, able to communicate with the mysterious.

> 玄
天也
The "mysterious"
refers to heaven.
古之仙士
能守信微妙
與天相通
Transcendent nobles of ancient times
were able to keep faith with the subtle and marvelous
and were in communication with heaven.[^15-1]

深不可識
Their depths were unknowable.

> 人行道奉誡
微氣歸之
When people practice the Dao and honor the precepts,
the subtle pneumas return to them.
為氣淵淵深也
故不可識也
These pneumas enter the innermost depths [of their bodies]
and are therefore unrecognizable.

夫唯不可識
故強為之容
Precisely because they are unknowable,
we are forced to fashion an appearance for them.

> 唯
獨也
Wei [precisely]
means "only, alone."
容
形狀也
"Appearance"
means shape or form.
獨行道
德備淵深
Only through practicing the Dao
is this store of power deeply implanted [in them].
不知當名之云何
強名之善為士者
Since we do not know what to call such people,
we are forced to call them "superior nobles."
道美大之也
It is the Dao that beautified and ennobled them.

豫若冬涉川
猶若畏四鄰
They were hesitant as if fording a winter river,
cautious as if fearing their neighbors.

> 冬涉川者
恐懼也
Those fording a river in winter are terrified.
畏四憐
不敢為非
恐鄰里知也
Those who fear their neighbors
do not dare to commit wrong
for fear that it will be known throughout the village.
尊道奉誡之人
猶豫行止之間
常當畏敬如此
People who revere the Dao and honor the precepts
hesitate in their actions
and should always be fearful and reverent in this manner.

儼若客
They were as self-controlled as guests.

> 謙不敢犯惡
若客坐主人堂也
Self-denying, they do not dare to transgress,
just like a guest sitting in the hall of a host.

散若冰將汋
Dispelling [their emotions] like ice that is beginning to melt;

> 情欲[^rse-15-1]思慮
怒熹惡事
道不所欲
Passion, worry, anger,
joy, and evil
are all things that the Dao does not desire.
心欲規之
便即制止解散
令如冰見日散汋
Your heart should regulate these emotions
and finally stop them,
causing them to scatter as ice melts under the sun.[^15-2]

混若樸
undifferentiated like uncarved wood;
曠若谷
broad as a valley;

> 勉信道真
棄耶知
守本樸
Striving to keep faith with the perfection of the Dao,
one should discard all deviant knowledge
and maintain one's original simplicity.
無他思慮
You should have no other concerns;
心中曠曠
only trust in the Dao should be found in the broad emptiness of your heart.
但信道如谷冰之志
東水不欲歸海也
Your aspiration should be like that of ice in the valley,
which desires only to flow east and return to the great sea.

肫若濁
they were complete and uniform, like muddy water.
濁以靜之徐清
Muddy water will gradually clarify through stillness.

> 求生之人
與不謝
When those who seek long life are given something,
they do not decline it;
奪不恨
when something is taken from them, they have no rancor.
不隨俗轉移
They do not follow the common run of people in their shifts and turns.
真思志道
Instead, their thoughts are perfectly directed toward the Dao.
學知清靜
意當時如癡濁也
While they are learning to be clear and still,
their thoughts will temporarily be as if confused and muddy;
以能癡濁
樸且欲就矣
but since they are confused and muddy,
they have maintained simplicity and are about to reach their goal.
然後清靜能睹眾微
Finally, in clarity and stillness, they will be able to observe all of the subtleties.[^15-3]
內自清明
不欲於俗
Since inside they will be clear and luminous,
they will not wish to draw near the common.
清靜大要
道微所樂
These essentials of clarity and stillness
are the delight of the subtle [pneumas] of the Dao.

> 天地湛然
則雲起露吐
萬物滋潤
When heaven and earth are unagitated,
clouds arise and the dew emerges,
providing moisture to the ten thousand things.
迅雷風趣
則漢燥物疼
When there is darting thunder and dashing wind,
violent desiccation harms living things.
道氣隱藏
常不周[^rse-15-2]處
\[At such times,\] the pneumas of the Dao hide themselves away
and there is no uniform distribution.
人法天地
故不得燥處
When people pattern themselves on heaven and earth,
they should consequently not reach this state of desiccation.
常清靜為務
晨暮露上下
人身氣亦布至
Through constantly striving after clarity and stillness,
the dews of morning and evening will ascend and descend [within them]
and the pneumas of the human body will consequently be uniformly distributed.[^xianger-23]
師設晨暮
清靜為大要
The Master has established these teachings concerning morning and evening [practices aimed at]
clarity and stillness as the most essential.
故雖天地有失
為人為誡
Though heaven and earth might slip from their courses,
these events merely serve as admonitions for the people. 
輒能自反
還歸道素
They will always be able to restore themselves,
returning to the simplicity of the Dao.
人德不及
Humans lack this power.
若其有失
遂去不顧
When they slip from the true course,
they depart without hope of return.[^15-4]
致當自約持也
This is why it is most important that you maintain your own integrity.

安以動之徐生
When you use stillness to move, [your actions] will gradually produce life.

> 人欲舉事
先孝之道誡
安思其義
不犯道
Whenever human beings wish to undertake some action, 
they should first gauge it[^xianger-24] against the precepts of the Dao,
considering it calmly to determine that the principles of their action
do not contravene the Dao.
乃徐施之
生道不去
Only then should they gradually pursue it,
so that the Dao of life does not depart from them.

保此道者不欲盈
Those who maintain this Dao do not desire fullness.

> 不欲志意盈溢
思念惡事也
One should not allow one's will to overflow
or contemplate evil actions.[^15-5]

夫唯不盈
能辭復成
Through this lack of fullness,
they are able to disintegrate and be renewed.[^xianger-25]

> 屍死為弊
When the corpse perishes, that is disintegration;
屍生為成
when it lives, that is "renewal."
獨能守道不盈溢
故能改弊為成耳
Only by holding to the Dao without allowing one's will to overflow
is one able to transform disintegration into renewal.
