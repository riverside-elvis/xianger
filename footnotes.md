[^03-1]: In physiological practice,
the bones were important as storehouses
of blood and essence.
The Heshang Gong commentary
also makes reference to "marrow" at this point.
For the importance of bones in Daoist belief,
see line 271 below and p. 355 ff.

[^04-1]: On the "centrally harmonious" pneuma,
see the section "Meditation and Perfection of the Body"
in the introduction to this text.

[^04-2]: This refers to number eighteen of the _Xiang'er_ precepts.

[^04-3]: Just as the rapid vibration of one lute string
causes the others to quiver,
so will a violent emotion in one of the five viscera affect the others.

[^04-4]: The five viscera and the corresponding qualities of their pneumas
are associated with the five phases as follows:
lungs (metal),
liver (wood),
urogenital system (water),
heart (fire),
gall bladder (earth).

[^04-5]: The terminology used to describe
the state of the pneumas here
derives from a method for determining
the stages in the cyclical progress
of each of the five phases
and their effect on
the five corresponding organs
of the human body.
The system mentioned in the _Taiping jing_ (65:232-33)
titles the five stages as follows:
ascendant 旺,
adjutant 相,
extended 休,
captive 囚 (translated here as "declining"),
and exhausted 廢.
At any point in the cycle,
one of the five phases will adopt each of these positions.
As Rao Zongyi
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [Hong Kong: Tong Nam, 1956], p. 70)
notes,
the point here is similar to that made in the _Taiping jing_.
A person's overall psychophysical health
is more important than where the body's pneumas are in the cycle.
Though at certain stages
(particularly mentioned is when yang is approaching fullness
and the heart is vivified over the other organs)
one can get angry without injury to the body,
it is best not to get angry at all.
This accords with the first of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not delight in deviance.
Delight is the same as anger."

[^04-6]: The "Thearchs" (*Di*) were,
as early as the Shang period,
regarded as the ascended ancestors of the king.
From 221 B.C.E. on,
living emperors adopted the title.
In Daoism, *Di* are the god-kings of the heavens.
In this text, the Yellow Thearch
occupies a special place (see below).
Although these lines are commonly taken to refer to the Dao,
our commentator in effect reads them in two ways simultaneously;
once as a description of the Dao,
and the second time as a description of
those who are able to successfully emulate the Dao.
This is a reading strategy used throughout the commentary.

[^05-1]: According to standard commentaries,
"straw dogs" were dogs made of plaited grass
used in a scapegoat ritual
(see Rao, _Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 80).
The commentary, in tracing this popular practice
back to a misunderstood warning from the Yellow Thearch,
indicates at the same time that all who continue this practice
are marking themselves as "disciples of the straw dog"
and outside of the Dao.

[^06-1]: That is to say,
the joining of male (yang) and female (yin)
in sexual intercourse
is for the purpose of producing living beings
in the same way that the "congealing of essence" in the body
produces internal spirits.
To understand the following discussion,
it is important to remember that "essence,"
in its grossest form contained in the sperm of the male,
was considered both a physical and a spiritual giver of life.
Any squandering of the essence, then,
wasted one's ability to form the spiritual embryo.

[^06-2]: "Laboring" at reproduction
refers to the various sexual practices
whose patrons are listed at lines 86-90 and 430-34.

[^06-3]: None of these spiritual entities engage in reproduction.
Heaven and earth, regarded as male and female, do not, by this account,
have offspring and so lack descendants to erect ancestral shrines to them.

[^07-1]: The word *xing*,
translated in this sentence as "to practice,"
also means "to move, to be mobile."
Coming on the heels of the previous sentence, then,
this sentence might be equally translated as
"It is not the Dao that moves them,
so their movements are entirely the motions of a corpse."

[^08-1]: On the "ascendant pneumas," see lines 20-26 above.

[^09-1]: The list of textual traditions here
are those alluded to in the earlier discussion of sexual practices.
The Yellow Thearch, Rongcheng, and the Dark Maiden
figure in the *Sunü jing* (Classic of the Unadorned Woman),
which was preserved in Japan in Tamba Yasuyori's _Ishimpō_,
compiled ca. 983 (see Wile, _Art of the Bedchamber_).
I have found no references to Gongzi outside of this text.

[^09-2]: "Unified" here stands for being one with the One---that is, the Dao.
The sense is that these practitioners of the sexual arts
are wrong not in seeking to control ejaculation,
but only in their reasons for doing so.
The purpose of their practice is not to give birth to internal spirits,
but rather to "control their delight."

[^09-3]: This would apply only to males,
since they are yang in nature.
"Deceiving the yin" refers to sexual practices
designed to borrow feminine essence to balance excess yang in the male.
Under such conditions, as the commentary states below,
"who would wish to loan?"

[^09-4]: "External explanation" (*waishuo*)
may refer to other written commentaries on the _Laozi_.
The Heshang Gong commentary does in fact
give a more general interpretation of this passage (_HY_ 682, 1:7b).

[^09-5]: This equates to number five of the _Xiang'er_ precepts.

[^09-6]: The story of the recluse Fan Li
is found in the earliest of Daoist hagiographies, the _Liexian zhuan_.
Fan served as adviser to the king of Yue
at about the time of Confucius.
According to this account,
he subsequently changed his name and went by sea to the kingdom of Qi,
where he again gained renown as a master of drugs and alchemical arts.
The brief biography concludes:
"[G]eneration after generation of later people have reported seeing him."
See Max Kaltenmark, _Le Lie-sien Tchouan_
(_Biographies légendaires des immortels taoïstes de l'antiquité_)
(Pékin: Université de Paris,
Publications du Centre d'Études Sinologiques de Pékin.
Reprint, Paris: Collège de France, 1987), pp. 102-4.

[^10-1]: The difficulty in determining
a precise target for the criticisms voiced here
is that any number of meditation practices
were called "holding (maintaining or embracing) the One" (*shouyi*, *baoyi*).
The same (or a similar) practice
seems also to have been known as "managing the One" (*zhiyi*).
For instance, Lu Yun (262-303), echoing the _Laozi_,
writes in his "Rhapsody on Recluses":
"Carrying and controlling, embracing the whitesouls;
they embosom the primal and manage the One [*zhiyi*],"
whereas his brother Lu Ji (261-303),
in his "Rhapsody on the Arrayed Transcendents,"
describes the practice in this way:
"Then they breathe in the nine yang pneumas;
embracing the One [*baoyi*] and holding in the primal.
They draw in the new [breath] and spit out the old."
(For more versions of this practice, see lines 211-15
below and endnote 26 to this translation.)

[^10-2]: As explained in the introduction, the term *wu wei*,
frequently translated as "inaction,"
means in this text "lack of artifice.'
Here the *wu wei* of the infant
is attributed to the fact that infants do not know
how to exercise "self-control"
and so their actions always accord with the Dao.

[^10-3]: Here *wu wei* is glossed as "not performing evil deeds."

[^10-4]: The male "orifice" is the urethra.
For the "previous paragraph," see lines 50 ff above.

[^11-1]: Xi Zhong is the culture hero
credited with the invention of the wheeled vehicle.
See Rao, _Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ (1956), pp. 80-81.

[^11-2]: It is difficult to escape the impression
that the commentator has here misunderstood, or willfully suppressed,
the meaning of this and the following three lines of the _Laozi_,
which argues that the utility of such things
resides as much in emptiness as in substance.
The more standard reading is:
The utility of a wheel derives from the empty spot where the spokes join;
the utility of a pot, from where there is no clay;
and the utility of windows and doors, from the space within.
The commentator seems to be reading "where they are not"
as "when they were not," which is equally possible grammatically,
but nonsensical in this case.
The reason for the commentator's insistence on a historical explanation
of these passages becomes clear once we realize
the sorts of glosses he wishes to refute.
See the following passages.

[^11-3]: The Heshang Gong commentary to this passage
contains traces of the "false arts" derided here.
After explaining the utility of the "hole"
at the hub of a cart---which the commentator equates
with metaphysical "emptiness"---he goes on to say,
"[T]hose who regulate their bodies
should root out emotion and banish desire,
so that their five viscera are vacant
and spirits may come to fill them" (_HY_ 682, 1:9a2-3;
Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, p. 123).

[^12-1]: In ancient Chinese medical thought,
eyesight was believed to be an interactive process.
In addition to emitting light,
an object would also have to be struck by "rays"
emanating from the eyes before it could be visible.

[^12-2]: The music of the two Warring States-period kingdoms
Zheng and Wei was regarded as lascivious and indulgent.
As a result, it was held to have corrupted the populace of the two kingdoms.
Knoblock (_Xunzi_, p. 78) gives the Confucian sources for this belief.
Here, it is likely to be a mere trope for popular music in general,
since it is opposed to *yayin* (elegant tones), the music of the court.

[^12-3]: For the passage referred to here, see lines 1-5 above.

[^13-1]: This is not the reading of most commentators.
Either they take the *ruo* to mean "like, similar to" in both cases,
or they suggest alternate interpretations,
as does the Heshang Gong commentary.
This is yet another example of how the _Xiang'er_ commentator
teases moral interpretations from the _Laozi_.
In this case, he derives number eleven of the _Xiang'er_ precepts
("Do not covet glory or seek it strenuously")
from his reading of the text.

[^13-2]: I have supplied the clause following the semicolon.
A more literal translation would be
"The Dao's aspiration is to be without body.
It wants only to nourish the spirits and that's all."
The final particle *erh* (and that's all) implies, I think,
that the Dao would not have a body
were it not for the necessity of providing existence to the spirits,
which inhabit its body in the same way
that lesser spirits inhabit the bodies of humans.

[^13-3]: "Child of heaven" is the term
commonly rendered "son of heaven"
and refers to the ruler.
The Chinese term employed is in fact the common word for "child," and,
although most rulers throughout Chinese history were male,
at least one woman, Wu Zhao (r. 684-705),
earned for herself the sobriquet Child of Heaven.

[^14-1]: This corresponds to number six of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not practice false arts or point to any shape and call it the Dao."
For the possible sources of such ideas, see endnote 26 to this translation.

[^15-1]: This passage is extremely close in wording
to the Heshang Gong commentary:
"[Superior noble] refers to the lord who has achieved the way.
The 'mysterious' is heaven.
This states that his will is in harmony
with the mysterious and subtle
and that his essence communicates with heaven" (_HY_ 682, 1:12a8-9).
The differences between the two interpretations highlight:
(1) the _Xiang'er_ commentator's emphasis
on the need to maintain faith with the Dao;
and (2) his widening of the frame of reference of the _Laozi_ text
so that such things are accessible to all.

[^15-2]: This advice relates to number seven of the Nine Practices:
"Practice desirelessness."

[^15-3]: This corresponds to number five of the Nine Practices:
"Practice clarity and stillness."

[^15-4]: According to Chinese ideas
on the correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm,
human "storms" of passion are precisely parallel to the thunderstorms
and wind-borne droughts of the world.
One apparent difference, though,
is that the earth recovers from storms,
but people are not often able to overcome
the results of their passionate outbursts.
Another possible problem with the notion of
such correspondences is that it is unclear
why heaven and earth, being so much closer to the Dao,
are subject to storms at all.
Both of these explanatory lapses are dealt with here:
heaven and earth are subject to storms
simply as a monitory warning to human beings.
For another expression of this idea,
see line 360 below.

[^15-5]: Once again, the _Xiang'er_ commentator
glosses "fullness" as "overflowing."
The "overflowing" of the individual will
is discussed more fully in lines 15-25 above.
[^16-1]: Once again, a parallel is being drawn between the body of the Dao
and that of people.
The "root" meant here is the human sexual organ.

[^16-2]: On the Palace of Grand Darkness,
where the last vestiges of dross in corruptible human bodies
are refined away through a process analogous to alchemical refinement
of base metals to celestial substances in the alchemist's crucible, see pp. 46 ff.

[^16-3]: The Earth Offices are one branch of the tripartite spiritual bureaucracy
of Celestial Master Daoism, the other two being the offices of Heaven and of Water.
The place to which these unfortunate souls are led is not here further specified,
but it is undoubtedly to be equated with the purgatories,
or "earth-prisons," of later texts.

[^17-1]: On the "disciples of the straw dog," see lines 40-43 above.

[^17-2]: This is one of the passages
in which the commentary slips into what is clearly the first person.
Since the pronoun "I" has been introduced as referring to the "Transcendent noble,"
we can only assume that this is the person speaking.
"Self-actualized" translates ziran,
a word often rendered as "nature" or "naturally."
Literally, it means "so of itself."
The emphasis, in short, is on independence and self-sufficiency.
This subtle emphasis is particularly important in the present context.
It is the Dao that is the ultimate source of the accomplishment,
not the inner resources of the Transcendent alone.

[^18-1]: Chinese philosophers divided the history of the world
into three stages of decline: higher, middle, and lower antiquity.
Lower antiquity tended to be identified with the recent past,
whereas the golden age of higher antiquity was variously identified.
For this text, higher antiquity refers to the utopian age of the Yellow Thearch.
"Humanity" [*ren*] and "responsibility" [*yi*]
are two of the preeminent virtues of Confucianism.

[^18-2]: The term "five scriptures" refers to the five classics
supposedly approved by Confucius, as designated during the Han period.
These were:
(1) the *Yi* [Book of Changes];
(2) the *Shu* [Book of History];
(3) the *Shi* [Book of Odes];
(4) the *Li* [Record of Rites];
and (5) the *Chunqiu* (Spring and Autumn Annals].

[^18-3]: The "six sorts of relationships,"
as defined by Confucian texts, vary somewhat,
but generally refer to one's relations with
father, mother, older brother, younger brother, wife, and child.
Sometimes affines are included.

[^19-1]: This refers to two sorts of talismanic writings or charts
that were believed to have been granted by heaven to confer its mandate
upon a new ruler. The Yellow River produced a "River Chart";
the Luo River, the "Luo Writings." See lines 447-50 below.

[^19-2]: This refers once more to the Confucian scriptures.
The sanctioned Confucian "arts" were
ritual, music, archery, horseback riding, calligraphy, and computation.

[^19-3]: "Inscribed bones" derives from the belief, common among Han Confucians,
that heaven has written one's fate in the shape of one's body and features.
The art of physiognomy, which had many regular and part-time practitioners,
found support in ancient texts that told of the strange marks
found on the bodies of the sage-kings of antiquity.
For instance, Wang Chong (27?-91), in the chapter of his _Lunheng_
devoted to the subject of physiognomy (chap. 11, "Bones and Features"),
begins by discussing the peculiar features of twelve Confucian sages.
Physiognomizing thus became an art directed to the identification
of the particularly worthy through observing physical marks and signs.
In Daoism, too, such oddities of the body as "inscribed bones" (see pp. 349 ff.)
became a sign of predestination. The belief is, in almost Lutherian fashion,
criticized here because it obviates the need for moral action.

[^19-4]: Wang Chong, whose writings attempt to debunk many popular Han beliefs,
including the pursuit of transcendence, may perhaps be among those meant here.

[^19-5]: In Celestial Master Daoism, transgressions were believed
to result in the subtraction of *suan* ("counts") from one's span of life.
A certain number of counts equalled a *ji* ("mark").
We have no accounts contemporary with this text
of how this system was thought to work.
Ge Hong relates that one count equaled either one or three days
and a mark was three hundred days (_HY_ 1177, 6:5b).
Another early text gives the figures one or ten days for a count and one year,
or three hundred sixty days, for a mark (_HY_ 615, 2:19a).
Whatever the system, the maximum penalty for an infraction,
mentioned in both this text and in the _Admonitions_, was three thousand.
The unit was most likely the *suan* or "count."

[^19-6]: Although this description could, with justice,
apply to any number of periods in Chinese history,
the detail concerning deserted capitals
(literally, "double-walled cities and feudatories")
may well apply to the period following the Yellow Turban rebellions,
when the hope for a period of "Great Peace" had been well and truly dashed.

[^20-1]: Thanks to the researches of Anna K. Seidel
("Traces of Han Religion" and "Post-Mortem Immortality"),
we now know that this phrase echoes those commonly found in mortuary documents
of the period meant to separate the realms of the living and the dead
and to protect the living from implication in the misdeeds
of their departed relatives.
Its use here reiterates the remarks (see lines 71-74 above)
portraying those outside the Dao as but "mobile corpses"---doing
so with a forcefulness that would not have been lost on contemporaries.

[^20-2]: The term used here, *mei*, is commonly translated "beauty."
In fact, it often denotes not merely a well-proportioned
and attractive physical appearance, but moral and psychic harmony as well.
By contrast, the word translated here "repellent" (*e*)
connotes also "flawed, evil, inharmonious."

[^20-3]: For more on the Daoist animus toward popular gods,
the blood-eating spirits of the unhallowed dead, see line 375 below.

[^20-4]: This accords with number twenty of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not commit any of the various evil acts."

[^20-5]: The "vulgar matters" referred to here are likely to include sex.
See lines 62-63 above, where it is stated that
"Transcendents lack wives, and Jade Maidens lack husbands."

[^20-6]: See lines 4-8 above. On practices for "eating pneumas," see pp. 42 ff..

[^21-1]: This is, of course, a misreading of the text.
Confucius is not mentioned in the _Laozi_.
Here the word *kong*, meaning "great" or "vast,"
is taken to be Confucius's surname, *Kong*, and to refer to the sage.

[^21-2]: On the image of the bellows, see lines 43-46 above.
The phrase "great spirit pneumas" or "pneumas of the great spirits"
refers to the spirits of heaven.

[^21-3]: According to Daoist belief, each person's fate
depended on records kept by the celestial bureaucracy.
These records were kept up to date by the deities that inhabited one's body,
who reported to the celestial record keepers on specified days.
The "right tally," kept in the celestial palace of long life,
contained the record of merits contributing to longevity,
and the "left tally," kept in Mount Tai,
contained records of sins and the date of one's death.
The dispatching of memorials to update these records
was part of the thrice-yearly meetings held at the parishes.
(See Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 334-42.)
In this passage, the term "essences" connotes the deities
formed of the essence and pneumas of the Dao that inhabit the body.
The fact that these deities report to the deities of the macrocosm
on both merits and demerits explains why it is necessary
not only to "congeal the essences" to form internal spirits,
but also to accumulate good merit.
For "counts," see line 272 above.

[^21-4]: This latter image likely alludes to the results of
unbridled sexual intercourse.

[^22-1]: This refers to such things as plants, which die in the fall and sprout again in the
spring.

[^22-2]: For the early Celestial Masters,
"embracing (or maintaining) unity" meant conserving
the psychophysical wholeness of the body
with its apportionment of spirits emanating from the Dao.
For criticisms of other practitioners' methods of "maintaining unity,"
see lines 110-13 and 211-15 above.

[^22-3]: This corresponds to number twenty-five of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not contend with others over right and wrong.
When you meet the contentious, flee them."

[^22-4]: As we saw above, "keeping one's merits whole"
involves receiving recompense for them not on earth
but from the celestial bureaucracy,
which keeps detailed tallies of individual action.

[^23-1]: From the syntax, it appears that *de*, "virtue, power"---the
active moral and suasive force of the Dao---here
is anthropomorphized in the same fashion as the Dao itself.
If so, the "powers" of the Dao would be the celestial spirits.

[^24-1]: The term "panting" refers disparagingly to practices of breath hygiene.
See Harper, _Early Chinese Medical Literature_, section 4,
for a variety of breath exercises to which this might refer.
It is perhaps significant as well that the Heshang Gong commentary,
glossing a different passage, holds that the pneumas of heaven and earth
enter the human body through the nose and mouth, respectively,
thereby forming the cloudsouls and whitesouls.
In order to achieve the proper nourishment of these bodily spirits,
"exhaling and inhaling, the successive breaths of the nose and mouth,
should be continuous and subtle"
(Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, p. 140).
Could this be what the _Xiang'er_ commentator derides as "panting"?

[^24-2]: On the tally of the left, see lines 325-28 above.

[^24-3]: This passage has been taken to refer to the bloody sacrifices
of popular religion.
However, the Celestial Masters also held that heaven and earth
properly lack "ancestral shrines" (see lines 62-3 above),
so it is likely that the Confucian state cult,
which involved the sacrifice of animals, was included as well.
The prohibition accords with number twenty-two of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not pray or sacrifice to demons and spirits."

[^24-4]: This remark seems to refer to the common Chinese practice
of consuming food offerings once the steam (*qi*) has ceased rising from them
and the spirits are presumed to have finished.
The prohibition expressed here, though, extends even to ritual items
used in such sacrifices.

[^26-1]: "Weightiness" (zhong) is here interpreted as
"to give weight to"---that is, "to value."
"Lightness" seems to have reminded the commentator
of the words essence and clarity, two of his key concepts,
which are homophonous, or nearly so, with the word *qing* [lightness].
Other than that, it is difficult to see how this commentary fits the text.

[^26-2]: The syntax of this passage leads one to suspect
another pun on *xing*, "to travel, put into practice, circulate."

[^26-3]: Other commentators read this passage of the _Laozi_
as referring to pleasure-loving rulers who
"belittle the realm for the sake of their own bodies."
The _Xiang'er_ commentator reads it as criticizing rulers who,
paradoxically, "belittle their bodies over [those of] the realm"
through imagining that they are too exalted to bow down before the Dao.

[^26-4]: This corresponds to number fifteen of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not slight [the Dao] or become agitated."

[^27-1]: For the significance of this, see the footnote to lines 325-28 above.

[^27-2]: The term "three streams in the heart"
refers to the "three paths of the Luminous Hall."
My interpolation of the word floodgates
is based on the metaphor of the body as a pond, found at lines 322a-31 above.

[^27-3]: The word *jie*, translated here as "dissolved,"
has the sense of "dissolution" of the physical forces of life at death.
This is clearly the metaphor the commentator wishes to evoke.

[^28-1]: In the writings of Han cosmologists,
based on _Laozi_ 42 ("The Dao gave birth to the one;
the one gave birth to the two;
the two gave birth to the three;
the three gave birth to the myriad things"),
"primal pneuma" was simply the first appearance of pneuma
in primordial nothingness. Unfortunately, we do not possess
the _Xiang'er_ commentary to _Laozi_ 42,
but from other early texts (see "Lord Lao and the Dao"
in the introduction to the _Admonitions_)
we know that the Celestial Masters regarded "primal pneuma"
as the third hypostasis of the Dao as it transformed itself
from formless nothingness into the myriad forms of existence.
Continuing to exist as an unaltered remnant of the original Dao,
it represents the most subtle and creative aspect of pneuma
and might be characterized as the Dao at work in the cosmos.

[^28-2]: "Borrowing" here refers to forms of sexual hygiene
in which the male restores his personal balance of yin and yang
by absorbing yin essence from a woman during sexual intercourse.
For the patrons of such sexual arts, see lines 87-90 above.

[^29-1]: These omens all originate from a type of prognosticatory literature
that was believed to represent "appendices" to the Confucian scriptures
and was collectively known as "weft texts."
(The primary meaning of the word scriptures in the phrase "Confucian scriptures"
was "warp," the guiding threads in a piece of weaving. The "weft" texts
were thus believed to interlock with and to complete the scriptures.)
These texts held that successive dynastic houses were in fact founded by half-divine,
half-human beings, whose births were attributed to the impregnation
of human women by the "essences" of the Five Thearchs of antiquity,
through the agency of emanations from the five naked-eye planets.
Primary among such writings, the very appearance of which augured
a new dynastic house, were the (Yellow) River Chart and the Luo (River) writings,
mentioned here as proclaiming the names of each new ruler.
The "seven lodgings" represent one direction (either north, south, east, or west)
of the twenty-eight lunar lodgings, those houses of Chinese astronomy
through which the sun, the moon, and the five naked-eye planets
were seen to move in orderly progression.
The "five wefts" were the five naked-eye planets:
Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn.
They were seen to circle clockwise through the firmament,
whereas the lodgings circled counterclockwise,
so that these asterisms too intermeshed like the weft and warp of a weaver's loom.
Through noting which of the lodgings appeared prominently in the sky
and the specific planet that seemed to lead the others to it,
the appropriate one of the five phases and its thearch could be determined.
Dynastic change was thus (at least in theory) rendered predictable,
since it followed the order of the five phases,
while at the same time it was entirely mandated by the will of heaven.
See Edward Schafer, _Pacing the Void: T'ang Approaches to the Stars_
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), pp. 54-84, 211-19.

[^30-1]: Since the Dao is responsible for all "shapes" of everything in the world,
it is necessary to explain why the Dao would have established weaponry.

[^30-2]: These verses demonstrate, through reference to the placement
of constellations associated with war and military matters in the heavens,
that the Dao holds warfare in low esteem. All of these military constellations,
which were observed carefully for any anomalies that might augur warfare on earth,
are distant from the center of heaven---the polestar.
The constellations listed here lie outside the circle of lunar lodgings
and so were visible in the northern hemisphere for only a brief time each year.
Storehouse and Tower, represented by ten stars in our Centaurus,
were associated with war chariots. Wolf and Bow, situated in Cancer,
were important in the prediction of foreign invasions.
General was the brightest among the Cavalry Officers, a group of
twenty-seven stars that were situated outside the lunar-lodging Chamber.
Lance, also known as "Barrier River," was formed by six stars in our Aquila.
*Xiuruo* remains unidentified.

[^30-3]: The notion that a person's transgressions adversely affect
the fate of his or her descendants, usually to the seventh or ninth generation,
is known as the doctrine of "inherited burden."
For more on the development of this idea, see p. 360.

[^30-4]: This seems to relate to the phrase (line 350 above)
"Evil is the axe that hacks away at the body."
Given the context, the specific evil meant here is most likely
pride and complacency.

[^30-5]: According to ancient legend, the Wind Supervisor (*Feng hou*),
whose name was revealed to the Yellow Thearch in a dream,
lived on a remote island, whence he was coaxed into becoming
one of the thearch's three ministers. After aiding the thearch in overthrowing
the rebel Chiyou, he was said to have composed books on the military arts.
(See the _Diwang shiji_, cited in the _Shiji_, 1:8.)
Zhou was the dissolute final ruler of the Shang dynasty,
who was overthrown by the Martial King, founder of the Zhou dynasty,
ca. 1045 B.C.E. Lü Wang (the byname of Lü Shang) was a commoner
who was recruited by the father of the Martial King while he was fishing,
as diviners had predicted to the king (_Shiji_, 32:1477-80).
Since the military exploits of both the Wind Supervisor and Lü Wang were foretold,
these men were regarded as having been divinely selected.
Thus, they had "no alternative" but to engage in warfare.
This discussion accords with the last of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not delight in arms."

[^31-1]: On the tallies of the left and right,
the spiritual records of a person's good deeds and transgressions,
see the footnote to lines 325-28.

[^31-2]: The argument of the _Laozi_ is that warfare is associated
with death since the arrangement of officers in ceremonial military functions
was like that of funerals in placing the highest ranks to the right.
Throughout this discussion, the _Xiang'er_ commentator associates the terms
left and right with the tallies of life and death kept by the spirits.

[^31-3]: This is done to win the submission of one's enemies
through the awesome power of the Dao rather than by military means.
On the "five commands," see p. 57.

[^32-1]: One of the facets of Chinese kingship constantly mentioned in various texts
is that when heaven approves of a ruler, the rain is timely.
Further, there are many records of heaven signaling its approval
by dropping "sweet dew" in the courtyard of the ruler.
But the focus of the _Xiang'er_ is here, as elsewhere, on the populace.

[^32-2]: This distinction allows the message of the _Xiang'er_
to appeal to the nobility, so long as they allow that their greatness
was thrust upon them.

[^32-3]: This matches number eight of the Nine Practices:
"Practice knowing how to cease with sufficiency."

[^33-1]: Although the source of this alternative explanation is not known,
it does seem to agree with the views on the emotions and their relationship
to the five phases and five viscera expressed earlier (lines 17-26 above).

[^33-2]: On the palace of Grand Darkness, where the bodies of the blessed are refined, and the Earth Office, to which the damned are consigned, see lines 227-30 above.

[^34-1]: Between the description of those granted the left and the right tallies
there is a subtle difference in wording that is clearly significant:
those who are not cautious concerning the precepts will be "placed" on the right;
those who are cautious "fit" the left. Given what precedes concerning
the importance of sincerity, mere caution is not quite enough to ensure
that one's name appears on the tallies of life.

[^34-2]: The Dao is not eternal, in the sense that it withdraws into itself
at the end of the cosmic cycle, to reemerge at the beginning of the next.
On this concept, see particularly lines 538-40 below.

[^35-1]: That is to say, territories will want to join the kingdom
without his even having to conquer them. That people will willingly
flock to a just ruler is a notion expressed in many early Chinese texts on statecraft.

[^35-2]: The auspicious omens include such things as the River Chart
(see lines 447-49).

[^35-3]: This describes, in simple terms, the idea that
the expansion and contraction of the Dao is the source of dynastic and cosmic cycles.
This concept is not fully explored in the commentary,
but all of its constituents are touched upon. Particularly prominent
is the idea that heaven gives signs of the arrival and departure of just rulers
through various celestial signs. Just enough detail is given to convince
any ruler reading this text that there was
"no choice but to earnestly and carefully investigate the Dao."

[^36-1]: This relates to number eight of the Nine Practices:
"Practice knowing how to cease with sufficiency."

[^36-2]: Once again, the source of the alternate explanation is unknown.
The first gloss takes the term *qi*, "implement, vessel,"
in the sense of the human body as vessel for the pneumas of the Dao.
Its concern is with the vital forces (and particularly sexual essence?)
that are created within the body by those pneumas.
The "other explanation" places the phrase entirely in the sphere
of social relations, but it differs slightly in moral emphasis
from what we have read earlier.
A Daoist should give to others, teach others, share with others,
even avoid angering others---not to accord with the precepts of the Dao,
but to avoid giving others advantage.

[^37-1]: This roughly coincides with number twenty of the _Xiang'er_ precepts:
"Do not commit any of the various evil acts."

[^37-2]: This expands on the statement, made earlier, that
"the Dao never acts falsely [*wu wei*]." The Dao does not coerce obedience,
but acts within its nature and so serves as a model for human rulers.

[^37-3]: On the division of antiquity into three ages and the depravity
of the latter age, see the footnote to line 245 above.
