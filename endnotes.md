[^xianger-1]: This is a conjectural emendation.
The beginning of the manuscript is torn,
and the bottom graphs of lines 1 and 2 are missing.

[^xianger-2]: The traditional understanding of this passage
is that it refers to the political "governance" of the Sage,
not self-regulation.
Since the commentary discusses techniques of physical cultivation,
it is clear that the author is reading
the pronoun qi 其 ("his, her, their")
in the first person rather than the third.

[^xianger-3]: Rao Zongyi
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], pp. 79-80),
citing references to the later Daoist meditation
"method of the four regulators" 四規
in which the "regulators" (*gui* 規) are bronze mirrors,
proposes that the term here refers to a mirror as well.
This explanation seems unnecessarily complex.
The term originally denoted a compass or a circular template.
The expanded meaning is
anything that regulates or establishes a pattern as to size or content.
For how the heart was believed to serve as a regulator, see lines 327-34.

[^xianger-4]: The term *jisi* 積死 here is puzzling.
Given the context it appears to be a contraction of
*jixi* 積習,
"to become accustomed to through long practice" (DKW 8:625d),
and *sijie* 死節,
"to refrain from something even on pain of death" (DKW 6:737a),
but I have found no occurrence of such a four-character phrase.

[^xianger-5]: The term *qiong* 窮,
translated here as "depleted,"
is a common trope for death.

[^xianger-6]: The expression *wu wei shi xian* 勿為事先
is somewhat unclear in meaning.
Number three of the "Nine Practices,"
based on this passage, reads:
"Practice maintaining the feminine.
Do not initiate actions [*su xian dong* 勿先動]."
Given the context here,
with its implied criticisms of sexual-hygiene practice,
it is likely that the phrase refers to males
striving to gain balance of yin and yang through sexual congress,
thus "falsely working to give themselves [literally, 'serve'] priority."

[^xianger-7]: The text has 知命, "knowing the mandate."
Used to indicate the age of fifty,
this phrase alludes to a passage in the _Analects_ (_Lunyu_ 2.4):
"The master said ...'At fifty I knew the mandates of heaven.'"

[^xianger-8]: *Wu* 無 is missing in the text
and is supplied on the basis of parallelism.

[^xianger-9]: Here I follow Rao
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojan_ [1956], p. 10)
in reading *buke* 不可 for *buke bu* 不可不.

[^xianger-10]: I have restored a *bu* 不 in the commentary
in accord with the line it glosses.
*Zi sheng* 自生 is generally reflexive ("to give life to oneself").
In the context of sexual reproduction,
we should read instead
"themselves give birth."
As the preceding passages indicate,
heaven and earth do not engage in sexual intercourse
and so "lack ancestral shrines."

[^xianger-11]: Both Rao and Mugitani have *mu ci* 目此,
but the manuscript reads 因此.
For the copyists way of writing the graph *yin*),
see line 212, for example.

[^xianger-12]: This is another major alteration of the _Laozi_ text
which in all other versions has *si* 私, "self-interest, selfish concerns,"
rather than *shi* 尸, "corpse."

[^xianger-13]: Reading *zhi* 止 for *xin* 心 in accord with the commentary.
The two graphs are closely similar in the *bafang* script of our manuscript,
which is presumably the same style as the manuscript from which it was copied.

[^xianger-14]: It is diffcult to see
how the commentator means to read this line of text.
Given the way he seems to have taken preceding lines,
we would expect a reading like "in giving, it favors humanity,"
but the word "to favor, to excel at, goodness," is clearly taken here,
as so often in the commentary, in the latter sense.

[^xianger-15]: Reading *fang* 仿 for *fang* 放.

[^xianger-16]: Reading *ruo* 若 for *ku* 苦.
My translation of the term *chuaiyue* 揣挩
as "control and harmonize" is conjectural.
I have found only one other appearance of the term,
in the _Guiguzi_ (_DKW_ 5:327b).

[^xianger-17]: The received version of the _Laozi_ has
"once achievement is complete,
fame follows and the person withdraws;
this is the Dao of heaven [成名遂身退]."
The order of the elements in the first clause is here reversed.
We should then read, following the gloss of the commentator:
"when fame is complete and achievement follows."
The commentator also takes 退 to mean "bodily decline,"
rather than "withdrawal" from the World of affairs.

[^xianger-18]: This and the following five entries are,
in the received version of the _Laozi_ all phrased as questions.
In the _Xiang'er_ manuscript, the question particle *hu* does not appear.

[^xianger-19]: *Shouyi* 守一,
the term I translate here as "maintaining Unity,"
is also translated as "embracing the One" or "holding the One."
In other texts, the term refers to various meditation practices
for visualizing and unifying the body's internal spirits.
See Poul Anderson, _The Method of Holding the Three Ones:
A Taoist Manual of Meditation of the Fourth Century A.D._
(London and Malm: Curzon Press, 1980),
and Isabelle Robinet, "Le Tatung Chen-ching,"
in Michel Strickmann, ed., _Tantric and Taoist Studies_, vol. 2
(Brussels: Insitut Belge des Hautes Études Chinoises, 1983): 120-38.
That is part of the meaning here as well,
in that the _Xiang'er_ precepts include injunctions
concerning unifying the body's spirits and essences.
But they also warn against all sorts of actions
that cause the Dao to depart and the body's unity to be lost,
which is why I have opted for this translation of the term.
See also Bokenkamp, "_Xiang'er_ Commentary," pp. 46-47.

[^xianger-20]: *Lan* 覽 means
"to survey, to gaze out across (a vast expanse)."
The gloss here does not seem to take account of the element of vision,
but it should be remarked that this is totally in line
with Chinese commentarial practice,
which assumed that the reader would know the word
and thus provided only suggestions
as to the sense in which that word should be read in specific contexts.

[^xianger-21]: Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 16)
interpolates the phrase *bude* 不得 at this point, reading
"[They] *do not obtain* that which they should obtain."

[^xianger-22]: The final clause of this line
is missing in the manuscript but is glossed in the commentary.
There is no grammatical indication
that this and the following line of the _Laozi_
are meant to be rhetorical questions,
yet the _Xiang'er_ commentator seems to read them as such.
His "answer," at any rate, directly contradicts
the normal understanding of the final clauses of each line:
"(to such a person) you can entrust the world."

[^xianger-23]: The Tang commentator Liangqiuzi 梁丘子
(Bai Lü-zhong 白履忠, fl ca. 722),
commenting on the line "[Transcendents] dine solely on the greatly harmonious,
the yin, and the yang pneumas" of the _Scripture of the Yellow Court_,
notes that those pursuing transcendence ingest yang breaths at sunrise,
yin breaths at sunset,
and "primal pneuma" on both occasions (_HY_ 263, 60:3a).
For further analysis of the practices alluded to in this passage,
see the section "Meditation and Perfection of the Body"
in the introduction to this text.

[^xianger-24]: Reading, with Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 20),
*kao* 考 for *xiao* 孝.

[^xianger-25]: The text here has *fu* 復 where the received edition has *bu* 不.
The implications of this are discussed in William G. Boltz,
"The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," p. 116.
Because I am following the commentary,
my translation of the line is a bit more forceful than his,
but the import is the same.

[^xianger-26]: Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_ p. 357 n. 2)
proposes that the object of attack here
might have been beliefs concerning
the "spirits of the five viscera"
as explicated in _Scripture of Great Peace_ (72:292, 722-23),
but these spirits are expressly
the "pneumas of the four seasons and the five phases"
and are not to be equated with the Dao---an equation that the
"false practitioners" criticized here apparently made.

    The heresy is not that such meditations involve internal spirits,
but that fhe Dao, the One, figures among them.
A more likely representative is an unnamed "transcendent scripture"
cited by Ge Hong 葛洪 (ca. 283-343) in his _Baopu zi neipian_:

    > Lord Lao said, "Undifferentiated. Vague.---Within are images.
Vague. Undifferentiated.---Within is a thing" [citing _Laozi_ 21].
It is the One of which he speaks.
Thus, a Transcendent Scripture states:
"If you wish long life, you must be clear on maintaining the One....
The One has both surname and byname and clothing of a certain color.
In males it is nine inches long; in females, six.
Sometimes it is 2.4 inches below the navel in the lower Cinnabar Field.
Sometimes it resides in the Scarlet palace,
within the Golden Porte below the heart.
This is the central Cinnabar Field.
Sometimes it resides between the eyebrows.
Preceding within [the head], one inch is the Luminous Hall,
two inches the Cavern Chamber,
and three inches the upper Cinnabar Field."
All of this information is valued by Daoists,
who have orally transmitted the names generatior after generation,
drawing blood [to seal their oath of secrecy].

    [_Baopu zi neipian_, 18:92.]{.right}

    For another translation, consult James R. Ware,
_Alchemy, Medicine and Religion in the China of A.D. 320: The Nei P'ien of Ko Hung_
(1966; reprint, New York: Dover Publications, 1981), pp. 301-2.
See also Chen Shixiang, "_Xiang'er_ Laozi," pp. 55-56.

[^xianger-27]: The received commentaries all read:
"(As for) the highest, those below know it exists."
But the _Xiang'er_ commentator finds somewhere in this phrase
reference to two sorts of knowledge.
I can only speculate that he is reading two preposed subjects rather than one:
"[As for those with] the highest [knowledgej,
the lowest knowledge---they possess it."
This is scarcely defensible grammatically,
but something like this must have been at the back of his mind.

[^xianger-28]: Reading, following Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 357), *duanque* 端慤.
The uncommon graph *que* is given at _DKW_ 4:1137c,
where it is glossed as "reverent, upright."

[^xianger-29]: As Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 357) has pointed out,
this character is wrongly transcribed in Rao,
_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ (1956), p. 24,
as *jie* 誡 rather than *cheng* 誠.

[^xianger-30]: On the basis of context,
I think that a *bu* 不 has dropped out of the text at this point.
If we take the text as given, another possibility might be to read:
"By [merely] making their actions filial
they would not achieve the longevity of the Transcendents, [so]...."

[^xianger-31]: Reading, with Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 367),
*dujiao* 都佼 for *xie wen* 邪文.

[^xianger-32]: Reading, With Rao (_Loazi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 26),
*bu sheng shou yi* 不勝受矣 for *by sheng yi shou* 不勝矣受.

[^xianger-33]: This line, not accounted for in the commentary,
differs markedly from received versions of the _Loazi_.
The translation given here is thus tentative,

[^xianger-34]: Mugitani ("Rōshi sōjichū sakuin," p. viii, line 14)
mistranscribes *shi* 實 as *bao* 寶.

[^xianger-35]: Reading, with Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 357),
*bao* 寶 for *shi* 實.

[^xianger-36]: Following Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 29)
in deleting *ke de* 可得,
which appears twice at this spot and is an obvious copyists error.

[^xianger-37]: Concerning this line of the _Laozi_ and the following,
see William G. Boltz, "The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," pp. 114-15.
I have not included in the translation the gloss
"*fu* 甫 means 'beginnings' [*shi* 始]."

[^xianger-38]: Following Rao's suggestion
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 31)
in reading the three occurrences of *huo* 或
in this paragraph as *huo* 惑, "beguiled, misled."

[^xianger-39]: Reading, with Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_ p. 357),
*hou* 後 for Rao's *fu* 復 (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 32).

[^xianger-40]: Omitted before this sentence is the phrase
*shu, shui ye* 孰誰也, which defies translation beyond the nonsensical
"Who means 'who.'"

[^xianger-41]: On the basis of the gloss below,
it seems that a second *dao* 道 has been deleted by the copyist at this point.

[^xianger-42]: See William G. Boltz, "The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," pp. 115-16,
on the emendations to this line.

[^xianger-43]: This is an obvious example of willful tampering
with the _Laozi_ text. The interpolated commentary and deletion
of the topic marker *ye* 也 separates the phrase
"From a standpoint within the Dao"
from the following phrase,
"It is called....,"
as we would otherwise translate the line,
and makes room for an additional interpolated speaker---the Dao.

[^xianger-44]: Following Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 34)
in removing the graph *jia* 家, and _DKW_ (3:953a)
in understanding the uncommon graph □ as *ji* 寂,

[^xianger-45]: The received text has "the king [not life] is great."
On this emendation, see William G. Boltz, "The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," p. 113.

[^xianger-46]: A semantic gloss, omitted in the translation,
reads: "*Xi* 奚 means *he* 何.
It is also close in meaning to *yao* 要 [essential]."
*Xi* is a common interrogative particle,
having roughly the same meaning as *he*,
but the latter part of this phrase does not follow logically.
Further, it is grammatically unlikely (if not impossible)
for the _Laozi_ to have an interrogative particle in this position.
Both the received version of the _Laozi_ and one Mawangdui text
give the reading *xi* 溪, "mountain stream freshet,"
which has traditionally been glossed in much the same way as
the "mysterious valley." We might, lacking a better explanation,
assume that the particle *he* here stands for its homophone
*he* 垓, "kernel, nugget," but we would still be unable to account
for the interrogative *xi*. If the text had been transmitted orally
before being copied down, we might propose that the original version read,
"*Xi* 溪 [mountain freshet] is a type of *he* 河 [river],"
which was misheard as "which is a type of what."
The "essential" nature of water to agriculture and transportation
might explain the following line of the gloss.

[^xianger-47]: Assuming, with Mugitani ("Rōshi sōjichū sakuin," p. xi, line 3),
that the second *tong* 同 is a copyist's error.
Even following Rao's punctuation (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 38),
however, the meaning would be proximate:
"It shares the same pneuma and is the same color as the primal."
In this case, the "primal" could be nothing other than *yuanqi*.

[^xianger-48]: The term *shen* 腎 is commonly translated as "kidneys,"
but, as Wile (pp. 20-21) has shown,
the term denotes the entire urogenital system, including the kidneys and testes.
I have thus left the term untranslated. The meditative practice of sexual abstention
outlined here is modeled on the belief that the Daoist's body,
after its feigned death, would hide away in the palace of Grand Darkness,
where it would be transmuted to emerge as a perfected, spiritual body
(see above, lines 227-30). In analogous fashion, the seminal essence
stored in the *shen* and not "utilized" in sexual intercourse
would be transformed into internal deities. One cognate meditation practice,
a variant of that alluded to here, is found in the Shangqing texts,
where it is known by the name "maintaining the dark and the white."
The meditator is told to envision
a black pneuma in the Niwan Palace (a cavity in the brain),
a white pneuma in the heart,
and a yellow pneuma in the navel.
These three pneumas are to envelop the meditator's body
and then turn into a blazing fire that engulfs the body
and makes it "as One."
This version also warns that engaging in sexual intercourse
invalidates the practice and leads to death.
See Robinet, "La révélation du Shangqing," vol I, pp. 40-41;
_HY_ 1010, 10:2a-2b; _HY_ 1010 13:14b-15a;
and _HY_ 421, 2:20b-21b.

[^xianger-49]: Following Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_ p. 357)
in reading *run zhu* 任住 for *ren wang* 任往.

[^xianger-50]: Reading, with Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 357),
*hou* 後 for *fu* 復.

[^xianger-51]: Reading, With Rao (_Loazi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 41),
*fu* 服 for the graph 敗.

[^xianger-52]: The text reads *lang hu*  狼孤, "wolf and fox,"
but must be a copyist's error for *hu* 弧, "bow,"
the nine-star constellation always associated With the star Wolf.
All of these star names, with the exception *Xiuruo* 脩柔---for
which I follow Rao and Mugitani, though the first graph seems unclear
in the manuscript---appear in the astronomical chapter of the _Shiji_
(27:1294-1306) under the lunar stations with which they are aligned.
This text also provides a general account of their significance in stellar
Prognostication. For the relevant passages,
see Rao, _Loazi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ (1956), p. 72.
On the system of lunar lodgings, see Schafer, _Pacing the Void_, pp. 79-84;
and Needham, _Science and Civilization in China_, vol. 3 (1959), pp. 231-59.

    The four lines in which these names appear are rhymed
and parallel in structure. They may be a citation from some other text
or perhaps a passage meant for memorization.
For another instances of rhyme in the commentary, see lines 495-97.

[^xianger-53]: *Guo*, the word translated as "achieve" here and below,
means "to bring to fruition." A more accurate gloss would be *cheng* 成,
"to accomplish," rather than *cheng* 誠, "full-hearted sincerity,"
but the commentator seems intent on drawing out of the text confirmation
of his moral message.

[^xianger-54]: Reading *huo* 惑 for *huo* 或,
a substitution that occurs several times in this manuscript.

[^xianger-55]: On this line, see William G. Boltz, "The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," p. 108.

[^xianger-56]: This section, as Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 83)
has noted, is rhymed.

[^xianger-57]: Reading "right" 右 for "left" 左 in the second phrase.

[^xianger-58]: Emending *dao* 道 to *min* 民 on the basis of context.

[^xianger-59]: Here the commentator has parsed the text so as to bring out
and emphasize the celestial auguries that were believed to accompany
heavenly appointed rulers. All other commentators break the text differently,
reading this passage "[The whole world] will come to you and suffer no harm;
instead, they will know safety and peace. Music and food,
these are what cause passing travelers to stop...."
Our commentator breaks the text right before the *and* in the sentence above
and takes "passing traveler" in its derived sense of "comet." *er* 餌,
the word just translated as "food," here written with
a slightly different graph (*er* 珥) that means "ring,"
is glossed in the commentary as meaning "light halo" or parhelion
of the sun and moon.
See Edward H. Schafer, _Mirages on the Sea of Time: The Taoist Poetry of Ts'ao T'ang_
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985).
Like other stellar anomalies, comets were regarded as inauspicious signs
for that area of earth corresponding to the celestial domain they invaded.
The terms translated as "unpropitious alignments" refer specifically
to the way cormets were believed to "stab" (*ce* 刺)
and "string together" (*guan* 貫) the constellations and lodgings.
Lunar and solar halos were also taken as inauspiciouis signs,
as were strange "criss-crossing" alignments of the planets
(Schafer, _Pacing the Void_, pp. 84-89, 109-16).

[^xianger-60]: Following Rao (_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [1956], p. 49)
in adding *yu* 與, the fourth member of the series.

[^xianger-61]: Reading, with Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 357), *qi* 齊 for *zhai* 齋.
