# Chapter 3

> 則民不爭
亦不盜
...then the people will not contend,
nor will they steal.

不見可欲
使心不亂
Not seeing that which is desirable
will make your heart unruffled.

> □□□不欲視之
比如不見
...Not desiring to see something
is like not seeing it at all.
勿令心動
Do not allow your heart to be moved.
若動自誡
If it is moved, restrain it.
即□道去復還
\[If you do so,\][^xianger-1] though the Dao departs, it will return again.
心亂遂之
道去之矣
But if you follow the wild promptings of your heart,
the Dao will leave for good.

聖人治
靈其心
實其腹
The Sage regulates
through emptying his heart
and filling his belly,[^xianger-2]

> 心者
規也
The heart
is a regulator.[^xianger-3]
中有吉兇善惡
It may hold fortune or misfortune, good or evil.
腹者
道囊
The belly
is a sack for the Dao;
氣常欲實
its pneumas constantly wish to fill it.
心為兇惡
道去囊空
When the heart produces ill-omened and evil conduct,
the Dao departs, leaving the sack empty.
空者耶入
便煞人
Once it is empty, deviance enters,
killing the person.
虛去心中兇惡
道來歸之
腹則實矣
If one drives off the misfortune and evil in the heart,
the Dao will return to it
and the belly will be filled.

弱其志
強其骨
through weakening his will
and strengthening his bones.

> 志隨心有善惡
The will follows the heart in possessing both good and evil.
骨隨腹仰氣
The bones follow the belly in accommodating pneuma.
彊[^rse-03-1]志為惡
氣去骨枯
When a strong will produces evil,
the pneumas depart and the bones are desiccated.
弱其惡志
氣歸髓滿
If one weakens the evil will,
the pneumas return and marrow fills the bones.[^03-1]

常使民無知無欲
He constantly causes the people to be without knowledge, without desire;

> 道絕不行
耶文滋起
貨賂為生
When the Dao is cut off and does not circulate,
deviant writings flourish
and bribery arises.
民竟貪學之
Then the people contend in their avarice and in their desire to study these writings.
身隨危傾
Consequently, their bodies are placed into grave danger.
當禁之
Such things should be prohibited.
勿知耶文
The people should not know of deviant writings;
勿貪寶貨
nor should they covet precious goods.
國則易治
Once this is accomplished, the kingdom will be easy to rule.
上之化下
猶風之靡草
The transformative influence of those above over those below
will be like a wind through the slender grasses.
欲如此
上要當知信道
If you wish this,
the essential thing is that you should know to keep faith with the Dao.

使知者不敢不為
and causes the knowledgeable not to dare inaction.

> 上信道不倦
多知之士
雖有耶心
猶志是非
If his highness tirelessly keeps faith with the Dao,
the knowledgeable,
even though their hearts have been perverted,
will still outwardly mark right and wrong.
見上勤勤
亦不敢不為也
Seeing his highness acting reverently,
they will dare not act otherwise.

則無不治
Then all is regulated.

> 如此國以治也
In this manner, the kingdom will be regulated.
