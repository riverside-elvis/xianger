[^rse-03-1]: Ctext sometimes uses 彊 where Wikisource has 強.
Since 彊 seems to have a more positive meaning in the text than 強,
I've preserved the difference. --RSE

[^rse-04-1]: Wikisource has 剋 here where ctext has 克,
both with definitions in Kroll close to Bokenkamp's "attack". --RSE

[^rse-05-1]: Wikisource uses both 于 and 於 where ctext uses only 於.
I've used 於 in all cases. --RSE

[^rse-05-2]: Wikisource has 噁 here where ctext has 惡,
but 噁 has the meaning "rant and rave" in Kroll, not "evil". --RSE

[^rse-05-3]: Wikisource has 龠 here and below.
Both are "a transverse flute of early times" in Kroll,
but 籥 is also "bellows", as translated by Bokenkamp. --RSE

[^rse-06-1]: Ctext incorrectly uses 牡 here instead of 牝,
and in phrases 玄牝門 and 牝地也 below. --RSE

[^rse-06-2]: Ctext uses 穀 for 谷 once here, once in 15, and once in 28,
but I've used 谷 in all three cases. --RSE

[^rse-07-1]: Wikisource has 屍 where ctext has 尸 in all cases. --RSE

[^rse-10-1]: Wikisource sometimes has 雲
where ctext has 云.
I've used 云 where it appears in the expression 云何,
both here and in 15,
and also where it clearly means a "verbal expression" in 13.
I've left it as 雲 in 15
where it clearly means "cloud",
but I've changed both to 芸芸
where it appears re-duplicated in 16,
which Bokenkamp translates as "crowded profusion",
and Kroll defines as "manifold and plentiful".
Both ctext and Wikisource
use 雲 in 19 where Bokenkamp translates it as "they say that",
so I've left it as-is since both agree,
though I have my doubts. --RSE

[^rse-10-2]: Wikisource has 崑崙 where ctext has 昆侖 for "Kunlun". --RSE

[^rse-10-3]: Wikisource has 製 where ctext has synonym 制. --RSE

[^rse-14-1]: Wikisource has 禦 where ctext has synonym 御. --RSE

[^rse-15-1]: Wikisource has 慾 here where ctext has 欲.
I've used 欲 since 情欲 is a more common idiom than 情慾 in Daoist texts. --RSE

[^rse-15-2]: Wikisource has 週 here where ctext uses 周.
I've used 周 since 周處 appears once as an expression in the _Huainanzi_,
but 週處 doesn't come up at all. --RSE

[^rse-18-1]: Wikisource uses 傚 here where ctext uses 效.
I've used 效 since 效法 appears as an expression in the _Yijing_,
but 傚法 doesn't come up at all. --RSE

[^rse-21-1]: Both Wikisource and ctext
use Unicode character U+25AEB here and in 27.
The character has ideographic structure ⿱竹下,
but can't be displayed. --RSE

[^rse-21-2]: Wikisource uses 泄 twice in 21 where ctext has synonym 洩. --RSE

[^rse-21-3]: Wikisource has 乾 here where ctext has 幹,
but only 乾 means something like Bokenkamp's "dry up" in Kroll. --RSE

[^rse-21-4]: Both Wikisource and ctext write "行山" here,
which I assume is meant to represent Unicode character U+275E3
with ideographic structure ⿴行山,
though I can't confirm its meaning as "pond bed". --RSE

[^rse-21-5]: Bokenkamp hasn't translated this phrase,
though it's in both ctext and Wikisource. --RSE

[^rse-24-1]: Wikisource has 余 here where ctext has 餘,
but according to Kroll, only 余 is a pronoun,
as Bokenkamp has translated it here. --RSE

[^rse-24-2]: Wikisource has 余 here where ctext has 餘,
but translated here as "excess" --RSE

[^rse-30-1]: Neither Wikisource nor ctext has a printable character here,
but Bokenkamp's endnotes write it as 敗, and read it as 服. --RSE

[^rse-31-1]: Wikisource has 凶 where ctext has synonym 兇, here and below. --RSE

[^rse-34-1]: Wikisource uses 泛 here where ctext has 氾.
Kroll points from 泛 to 氾. --RSE

[^rse-35-1]: Wikisource uses 余 (a pronoun) where ctext has 餘,
a better match for Bokenkamp's "excessive". --RSE
