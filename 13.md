# Chapter 13

寵辱若驚
Accorded favor or disgrace, be as if startled.
貴大患若身
Honor will greatly injure your body.

> 道不熹強求尊貴
The Dao does not delight in those who strenuously seek after status and honor.
有寵輒有辱
Where there is favor, disgrace always accompanies it.
若
如也
The first *ruo*
means "as if."
得之當如驚不熹也
When you achieve favor, you should be as if startled---less than delighted about it.
若者
謂彼人也
The second *ruo*
is the second-person pronoun.[^13-1]
必違道求榮
One must depart from the Dao to seek glory.
患歸若身矣
The injury thereby engendered will return to your body.

何謂寵辱為下
What does it mean to denigrate both favor and disgrace?
得之若驚
失之若驚
One should be as if startled both in obtaining
and in losing them;
是謂寵辱若驚
this is what is meant by "Accorded favor or disgrace, be as if startled."

> 為下者
貪寵之人
計之下者耳
To "denigrate"
indicates that those covetous of honor
are lowest in [the Dao's] estimation.
非道所貴也
They are not held in esteem by the Dao.

何謂貴大患若身
What is meant by "honor will greatly injure your body"?

> 如前說
See above.

吾所以有大患
為我有身
The reason I suffer great injury
is because I have a body.

> 吾
道也
我者
吾同
The first-person pronouns here
refer to the Dao.
道至尊
常畏患
不敢求榮
思欲損身
The Dao is of the highest worthiness,
yet it constantly fears injury
and does not dare to seek glory,
since concentration on such desires injures the body.
彼貪寵之人
身豈能勝道乎
Can the bodies of those who covet honor
be superior to the body of the Dao?
為身而違誡
非也
It is wrong to transgress the precepts for the sake of one's body.

及我無身
吾有何患
Reaching the state where I have no body,
then what could harm me?

> 吾我
道也
The first-person pronouns
refer to the Dao.
志欲無身
The Dao's aspiration is to be without body.
但欲養神耳
It wants to nourish the spirits;
that is the only reason it has a "body."[^13-2]
欲令人自法
故云之
Desiring that people model themselves on this,
the Dao expresses it.

故貴以身於天下
Thus, you who are honored in body by the world---can responsibility for the world be delegated to you?[^xianger-22]

> 若者
謂彼有身貪寵之人
"You"
here refers to those who covet honor for the sake of their persons.
若以貪寵有身
不可託天下之號也
Such as these
should not be entrusted with the title of ruler of the world.
所以者
Why is this?
此人但知貪寵有身
必欲好衣美食
廣宮室
高臺榭
積珍寶
Such persons know only to covet honor for their own sake
and so will necessarily desire fine clothes, sumptuous foods,
spacious palaces,
lofty towers,
and amassed wealth.
則有為
令百姓勞弊
For the sake of these things they will act willfully,
causing the commoners to labor and suffer.
故不可令為天子也
As a result, such as these may not be made "child of heaven."[^13-3]

> 設如道意
有身不愛
不求榮好
不奢侈飲食
常弊薄羸行
If, on the other hand, one were to accord with the intentions of the Dao,
one would possess a body but not cherish it,
would never seek glory and favor,
would not be profligate in eating and drinking,
would always be frugal, and would hide good actions.
有天下
必無為
守樸素
合道意矣
Such a person, possessing the world,
would certainly be without artifice
and would maintain simplicity,
entirely in accord with the will of the Dao.

> 人但當保身
不當愛身
People should only preserve their bodies,
not cherish their bodies.
何謂也
And why is this?
奉道誡
積善成功
積精成神
Keeping the precepts of the Dao,
we amass good deeds, which accrue merit
and assemble our essences to form [internal] spirits.
神成仙壽
Once the spirits are formed, we enjoy the longevity of the Transcendents.
以此為身寶矣
In this way we find our bodies treasured.
貪榮寵
勞精思
以求財
Those who covet worldly glory
squander their essences and mental concentration
in pursuit of wealth.
美食以恣身
They place great value on food to pamper their bodies.
此為愛身者也
This is how they cherish their bodies.
不合於道也
Such actions do not accord with the Dao.

愛以身為天下
若可寄天下
You who cherish your body as if it were the world,
can the world be entrusted to you?

> 與上同義
The meaning of this line is the same as that preceding.
