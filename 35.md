# Chapter 35

執大象天下往
Grasp the great image and all under heaven will proceed to you.

> 王者執正法
像大道
天下歸往
If the king grasps the correct law
and models himself on the great Dao,
all under heaven will take refuge in him.
曠塞重驛
向風而至
Vast territories requiring numerous post stations
will arrive as if borne on the wind.[^35-1]
道之為化
自高而降
The transformative influence of the Dao
proceeds down from the top.
指謂王者
故貴一人
When it designates a king,
it values the "one man."
制無二君
是以帝王常當行道
然後乃及吏民
In its rule there are no "two lords."
This is why the thearchical king should constantly practice the Dao---so
that it will spread to his officers and to the populace.
非獨道士可行
王者棄捐也
It is not the case that only Daoists can practice it
and the ruler is cast aside.
上聖之君
師道至行以教化
天下如治
A lord of great sageliness
who makes the Dao his master and perfects the practice, transforming all with the teaching,
will find the world in order.
太平符瑞
皆感人功所積
The auspicious omens betokening Great Peace
will accumulate in response to human merit.[^35-2]
致之者道君也
One who achieves this is truly a Lord of the Dao.

> 中賢之君
志信不純
政復扶接
能任賢良
A lord of middling worthiness,
whose aspiration and faith are not pure,
will find his rule supported
and will be able to employ worthy officials.
臣弼之以道
These ministers will aid him by means of the Dao.
> 雖存國
會不蕩蕩
勞精躬勤
Though in this way the kingdom will be preserved
and will remain unshaken,
it will exhaust his essences and belabor his body.
良輔朝去
暮國傾危
If his excellent adjutants depart one morning,
the kingdom will be in danger of toppling by evening.
制不在上
故在彼去臣
所以者
化逆也
This is because order came not from above
but from those departed ministers,
and in this way
the transformative influence of the Dao was subverted. 

> 猶水不水不西
雖有良臣
常難致治
Just as water cannot flow to the west,
so is it difficult to achieve lasting order
even with the most excellent of ministers.
況群耶雜政
How much more difficult it is when all sorts of deviant influences are mixed in governance!
制君諱道
非賤真文
以為人世可久隨之
王者道可久棄捐
\[How much more difficult it is\] when the ruling lord transgresses the Dao,
belittling the perfected texts
in the belief that the human world will persist in following him
and in the belief that, as king, he can continue to discard the Dao!

> 道尊且神
The Dao is both exalted and spiritual.
終不聽人
It will never obey humans.
故放精耶
變異汾汾
將以誡誨
Thus, it releases sprites and perversities
and causes all sorts of transformed oddities
to spread as an admonition and warning.
道隱卻觀
The Dao then hides away to observe.
亂極必理
When disorder reaches its apex, order invariably returns;
道意必宣
the will of the Dao inevitably prevails.[^35-3]
是以帝王大臣
不可不用心殷勤審察之焉
This is why the thearchical king and the great ministers
have no choice but to earnestly and carefully investigate the Dao.

佳而不害
When they proceed to you, there will be no harm.

> 王者行道
道來歸往
When the king practices the Dao,
the people[^xianger-58] will proceed to him.
王者亦皆樂道
They will all delight in the Dao.
知神明不可欺負
不畏法律也
乃畏天神
不敢為非惡
Knowing that the spirit luminaries cannot be deceived,
they will fear the celestial spirits,
not laws and regulations,
and will not dare to commit wrong.
臣忠子孝
出自然至心
The loyalty of ministers and the filiality of children
will proceed spontaneously from their perfected hearts.
王法無所復害
The king's law will no longer cause harm to anyone.
形罰格藏
Corporal punishments---mutilations, floggings, stocks, and jails---will be no more.
故易治
王者樂也
Thus the people will be easily ruled
and the king will enjoy happiness.

安平大樂
There will be peace and great happiness,

> 如此之治
甚大樂也
When the king rules in this fashion,
there will be great happiness.

與珥過客止
and parhelia and passing comets will cease.

> 諸與天災變怪
日月運珥
倍臣縱橫
刺貫之咎
過罪所致
All harm associated with disastrous celestial transformations and anomalies---light
halos around the sun and moon,
encroachments of the stellar officers,
and unpropitious alignments of the heavenly bodies---is
brought about through human transgression.
五星順軌
客逆不曜
\[Under the good king,\] the five planets will follow their appointed courses
and invading "guest stars" [i.e., comets] will not flare forth.
疾疫之氣
都悉止矣
Pestilential pneumas
of all sorts will cease.[^xianger-59]

道出言
淡無味
When the Dao speaks,
its words are insipid and lacking in flavor.

> 道之所言
反俗絕巧
於俗人中
甚無味也
The words of the Dao run counter
to the craftiness of common speech,
and so the profane
find them extremely flavorless.

> 無味之中
有大生味
Within this flavorlessness
there is the savor of life;
故聖人味無味之味
thus the Sage savors the savor of the flavorless.

視不足見
聽不足聞
用不可既
To look at---it is not worth seeing;
to hear---it is not worth listening to;
but in use it cannot be exhausted.

> 道樂質樸
The Dao delights in simplicity.
辭無餘[^rse-35-1]
Its words are not excessive.
視道言
聽道誡
或不足見聞耳而難行
Looking at the words of the Dao
or hearing the precepts of the Dao,
some feel that they are so hard to carry out that they are not worthy of regard.
> 能行能用
慶福不可既盡也
But those who are able to practice them and use them
will receive blessings without end.
