# Appendix: Transcriber's Notes

This is a mashup of
base text from
[Wikisource](https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/老子想爾注)
and [ctext](https://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=en&chapter=902619)
with Stephen R. Bokenkamp's translation
from "The _Xiang'er_ commentary on the _Laozi_" chapter
of _Early Daoist Scriptures_, 1997.

Bokenkamp's base text seems to be
a photographic copy of Dunhuang manuscript S 6825
reproduced in Ōfuchi Ninji, _Tonkō dōkyō mokurokuhen_, 1978,
which I haven't consulted.
Where Wikisource and ctext differ,
I've taken my best guess
and left a note.

The _Xiang'er_ manuscript
doesn't split the base text into chapters,
and neither does Bokenkamp,
but I've done so here.
Chapter divisions are based on
the line-number to chapter-number table
in Bokenkamp's introduction.

Bokenkamp's original text
contains both footnotes and endnotes,
but I've collated them here.
