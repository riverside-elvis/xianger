# Chapter 12

五色令人目肓
The five colors are what make people blind.

> 目光散故盲
They cause the dispersion of light rays from the eyes and, thus, eventual blindness.[^12-1]

五音令人耳聾
The five tones are what make people deaf.

> 非雅音也
This does not refer to the elegant tones [of ritual music].
鄭衛之聲
抗諍傷人
The sounds of Zheng and Wei
clash inharmoniously and so injure people.[^12-2]
聽過神去
故聾
Listening to them too much causes one's [internal] spirits to depart
and eventual deafness.

五味令人口爽
The five flavors rot peoples' mouths.

> 道不食之
Those of the Dao do not eat them.
口爽者
糜爛生瘡
"Rotting the mouth"
refers to oral putrescence and cankers.

馳騁田獵
令人心發狂
Racing about on horseback and hunting
makes peoples' hearts go mad.

> 心不念正
但念煞無罪之獸
當得故狂
This is because the heart is not fixed on what is correct
but concentrates only on the slaughter of innocent animals,
fueled by the desire to obtain all that have not yet been caught.[^xianger-21] Madness results.

難得之貨
令人行妨
Goods that are difficult to obtain
cause people to practice obstruction.

> 道所不欲也
This is something the Dao does not desire.
行道致生不致貨
One should practice the Dao to gain life, not to gain material goods.
貨有為
Material goods lead to artifice;
乃致貨妨道矣
thus, obtaining them will obstruct the Dao.

是以聖人為腹不為目
This is why the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes.
故去彼取此
As a result, you should depart from that to adopt this.

> 腹與目
前章以說矣
In earlier paragraphs the eyes and the belly were discussed.[^12-3]
去彼惡行
取此道誡也
One should depart from those evil actions
and adopt these Daoist precepts.
