[^intro-1]: The sole copy of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
is the Dunhuang manuscript S 6825,
which begins at the end of *zhang* 3 and continues through *zhang* 37
of the received _Laozi_ text.
For a fuller account of the manuscript,
see the section "The Authorship and Date of the _Xiang'er_ Commentary."

[^intro-2]: _Laozi_, 19. See lines 265-77 of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
for what it has made of this injunction.

[^intro-3]: This "rediscovery" of the _Laozi_ has been fueled primarily
by the Mawangdui manuscripts of the text,
recovered in 1973 from an early Han tomb.
The modern scholarly interpretations of the _Laozi_ followed here
are listed in the footnotes below.

[^intro-4]: Bradbury ("The American Conquest," p. 33)
cites Witter Bynner's vivid characterization of Daoism
as "a cult compounded of devils and derelicts,
a priest-ridden clutter of superstitions founded on ignorance and fear."
We can clearly see the prejudices lurking behind
such bald statements of contempt,
but need to guard as well against more subtle biases against "popularization"
found in both ancient and modern references to Daoist uses of the _Laozi_,
for these invariably tell us more about the views
of the person expressing them than about the _Laozi_ text itself.
Among recent heritors of Bynner's jaundiced view, for instance,
we must include those who attempt to distinguish
the "mystical" dimension in Daoism from the "liturgical,"
privileging the former by tracing its descent from the _Laozi_
and the _Zhuangzi_ and relegating the latter to "folk religion."
For one example,
see Christian Jochim, _Chinese Religions: A Cultural Perspective_
(Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1986), pp. 8-10.

[^intro-5]: See "Structure and Conventions of the Translation"
at the end of this introduction.

[^intro-6]: The primary historical sources
for the early history of the Celestial Masters
are the _Sanguo zhi_ [Annals of the Three Kingdoms] of Chen Shou 陳壽 (233-297)
and the _Huayang guozhi_ [Annals of the Kingdoms South of Mount Hua]
by Chang Qu 常璩 (fl. 347),
supplemented by Fan Ye's 范曄 (398-445)
_Hou Han shu_ [History of the Latter Han].
There also survive in the commentaries to these works
citations from lost histories of the period.

[^intro-7]: The question of whether the early Celestial Masters
should be considered a regional offshoot
of the Yellow Turbans' rebel movement
will be touched upon later.

[^intro-8]: The following account is drawn from several sources,
including Werner Eichhorn,
"Description of the Rebellion of Sun En and Earlier Taoist Rebellions,"

and 2.3 (1954), pp. 463-76;

See particularly Mansvelt-Beck for the controversies surrounding
the relationship between the Yellow Turbans and the Celestial Masters.

[^intro-9]: Zhang Jue
seems also to have been influenced by Huang-Lao doctrines.
Huang-Lao was a political philosophy that gained prominence
early in the Han dynasty.
As the name of the school implies,
its doctrines were expressed in texts associated with
the Yellow Thearch (Huang Di) and with Laozi (the _Daode jing_).

[^intro-10]: On the use of incantation, talismans,
and "talisman water" in early medicine, see Donald Harper,
_Early Chinese Medical Literature: The Mawangdui Medical Manuscripts_
(London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1996).

[^intro-11]: Kaltenmark, "Ideology of the *T'ai-p'ing ching*," pp. 33-38.

[^intro-12]: The following sketch of the early history
of the Celestial Masters draws on Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_,
and Terry F. Kleeman,
_Great Perfection: Religion and Ethnicity in a Chinese Millennial Kingdom_
(Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, forthcoming).

[^intro-13]: This mountain, known by various other names as well,
has been identified with the modern Heming Shan 鶴鳴山,
which lies some fifty kilometers to the west
of the provincial capital, Chengdu.

[^intro-14]: According to some Daoist accounts,
the _Scripture of Great Peace_ was among the works bestowed on him.
There is in fact evidence,
some to be found in the _Xiang'er_ commentary itself,
that the Celestial Masters did indeed know
a version of the _Scripture of Great Peace_
that has come down to us.
Certain of the doctrines found in that text are adopted,
and others disputed, in the _Xiang'er_ commentary.

[^intro-15]: There is, however,
a fascinating stele inscription dated 173 C.E.
that gives evidence of the Celestial Master transmission
of texts and establishment of Libationers.
See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 41-44;
and Ursula-Angelika Cedzich,
"Das Ritual der Himmelsmeister im Spiegel früher Quellen:
übersetzung und Untersuchung des liturgischen Materials
im dritten chüan des Teng-chen yin-chüeh"
(Ph.D. diss., Julius-Maximilians-Universität, Würzburg, 1993), pp. 32-33.

[^intro-16]: Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 46-49.
On the appellation "Five Pecks of Rice"
and the system of twenty-four parishes,
see the discussion later in this introduction.

[^intro-17]: Accounts of Zhang Xiu's death differ,
and none of the sources provide information
on his relationship to Zhang Lu.
The _Sanguo zhi_ and _Hou Han shu_
report that Zhang Lu murdered Zhang Xiu himself.
The _Dianlüe_, though not stating that Zhang Lu killed Xiu,
holds that "because of the faithfulness of Xiu's people,
[Zhang Lu] carried on Xiu's enterprise
and embellished \[Xiu's "Way of the Five Pecks of Rice"]
(cited in the _Sanguo zhi_, 8:263).
The _Huayang guozhi_ reports that Zhang Xiu died in battle.
The lack of information on Zhang Xiu,
who is not mentioned in Daoist sources,
has led many scholars,
beginning with the _Sanguo zhi_ commentator Pei Songzhi,
to propose that the graph *xiu* is an error for *heng*
and that the passage must be referring to Zhang Lu's father.
This assumption seems unwarranted.
See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 46-47.

[^intro-18]: This is the sort of round figure
normally reported in the histories.
The best estimate is that the Hanzhong community
was in existence for about twenty-four years,
from roughly 191 to 215.
See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 46.

[^intro-19]: Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 50-53.

[^intro-20]: Zhang Lu's mother---who was
favored "for her practice of the Way of the Revenants
and for her youthful appearance"
by the military governor of Shu, Liu Yan 劉焉---and
other members of Zhang Lu's family had been kept behind in Shu
as a warranty of his good faith.
After Liu Yan's son succeeded Liu,
he murdered Zhang Lu's mother and family members.
(_Sanguo zhi_, 31:867)

[^intro-21]: In fact, Chinese imperial government was,
throughout its history, based on principles
that we today would call religious.
It was a system in which, in the words of Maurice Freedman,
"Caesar was the Pope and the Pope, Caesar."
There were, however, unique features in the governance Zhang Lu proposed.
These will be explored in the section called "Morality and Governance."

[^intro-22]: See the introduction to the _Admonitions_.

[^intro-23]: For descriptions of those who do not keep faith with the Dao
as "mobile corpses," see lines 71-74 and 248-49 of the _Xiang'er_ commentary.

[^intro-24]: The title is derived from the Han administration,
where it was granted to morally upright elders in the local community.
The Celestial Masters applied the title both to men and to women.
See Rolf Stein,
"Remarques sur les mouvements du taoïsme politico-religieux
au IIe siècle ap. J.C.," _TP_ 50 (1963), pp. 42-59.

[^intro-25]: Stein, "Religious Taoism," pp. 69-72.

[^intro-26]: This is not so strange as it might sound.
These two words share a phonetic element and were pronounced similarly.
We know from the Mawangdui silk manuscript copy of the _Laozi_ that,
during the Warring States period,
many homophonous words were written with the same graph
and that the radicals found in received editions were added later.
The _Xiang'er_ commentator has here merely implied a radical
where other commentators have not.

[^intro-27]: For expressions of this view,
see Léon Vandermeersch, _La formation du Légisme_,
_PEFEO_, no. 56 (Paris, 1965), pp. 240-70;
Seidel, "Der Kaiser und sein Ratgeber," pp. 18-50;
Seidel, "Das neue Testament des Tao," pp. 147-72;
Graham, _Disputers of the Tao_, p. 170;
and Ren Jiyu, ed., _Zhongguo daojiao shi_
(Shanghai: Renmin chubanshe, 1990), pp. 37-38.

[^intro-28]: Seidel, "Der Kaiser und sein Ratgeber."
These observations are not meant to imply
that the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi commentaries to the _Laozi_
were entirely apolitical in emphasis.
As Alan K.L. Chan has noted in his study of the two commentaries:
"Both Wang Bi and Heshang Gong are motivated
by a fundamental practical concern for the well-being of the country.
This, indeed, is true not only for the two commentaries,
but characterizes much of traditional Chinese thought as a whole"
(Alan K.L. Chan, _Two Visions of the Way: A Study of the Wang Pi and the Ho-shang-kung Commentaries on the Lao-tzu_
(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991], p. 167).
We are dealing, instead, with the beginnings of the view
expressed in many modern translations of the book,
that the _Laozi_ text is primarily concerned with self-cultivation.
This view seems to have originated in the ardent debates of the Han
over the nature of the "Sage"---the privileged being
who is able to mystically comprehend the Dao
and who is thus fit to advise the ruler,
but might equally well withdraw into the mountains.
The role of the _Zhuangzi_ text in this Han-period development,
which we tend from our vantage point to assume as a fact,
has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.
On Wang Bi's and Heshang Gong's views of the sage,
see Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, pp. 34-36 and 157, respectively.

[^intro-29]: Some modern scholars have made much of the fact
that the "term" *daojiao* appears in the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
See, for instance, Rao Zongyi,
_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ (Shanghai: Guji chubanshe, 1991), p. 53;
and Kobayashi Masayoshi, _Rikuchō dōkyōshi kenkyū_
(Tokyo: Sōbunsha, 1990), pp. 314-16.
Kobayashi even argues that,
since the term is used to denote the Daoist religion only much later,
the _Xiang'er_ could not have been written in the early third century.
In fact, the two words, *dao* and *jiao*, do appear in conjunction,
but not as a proper noun denoting the religion as a whole.
Instead, the verb *jiao*, "to teach," appears
among other verbs describing actions of the Dao.
In line 87 of the _Xiang'er_ commentary, for example,
it is stated that "[t]he Dao teaches people to..."
Thus, when the verb *jiao* appears
on one occasion without an object (line 247),
we should read, pace Rao and Kobayashi,
"the teachings of the Dao" and not "Daoism."

[^intro-30]: This is apparent in the _Admonitions_ as well,
which speaks of a series of manifestations of the Dao in the world
where other texts speak of the reappearances of Lord Lao.

[^intro-31]: This is literally so,
for throughout the text the _Xiang'er_ commentator
glosses first-person pronouns in the _Laozi_ with the words
"'I' refers to the Dao."
On only two occasions are there other speakers identified,
and these are both said to be the words
of a "Transcendent noble" (lines 241-43 and 305-321).
But since this person or these persons are, as the context makes clear,
transcended beings and thus joined with the Dao,
the switch of voices is not nearly so jarring in Chinese
as the English makes it sound.

[^intro-32]: See lines 567 ff.

[^intro-33]: My procedure here is more fully explained in Bokenkamp,
"Traces of Early Celestial Master Physiological Practice
in the _Xiang'er_ Commentary," _TR_ 4.2 (December 1993), pp. 37-51.

[^intro-34]: See line 391: "Daoists should value their essence
and [internal] spirits.
Clarity and stillness are the basis [for accomplishing this]."

[^intro-35]: Lines 203-4. The "Master" is not specified.
Most likely, the term here refers to Zhang Daoling,
indicating that this practice was attributed to him.

[^intro-36]: The attitude displayed here concerning "clarity and stillness"
is closest to that found in the teaching verse
of Guang Chengzi 廣成子 (_Zhuangzi_, 11:36):
"You must be still; you must be clear. \/
Do not belabour your body. \/
Do not excite your seminal essences. \/
Thus will you live long."
For a discussion and translation of the entire verse,
see A.C. Graham,
_Chuang-tzu: The Inner Chapters_ (London: Unwin Paperbacks, 1986), pp. 176-78.

[^intro-37]: Such visualizations are criticized
specifically at lines 106-12 and 175-80,
and the "false arts" these lines condemn
are discussed in endnote 26 to my translation of the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
See also Bokenkamp, "_Xiang'er_ Commentary," pp. 44-47.

[^intro-38]: Harper (_Early Chinese Medical Literature_, sec. 4)
discusses various early texts that contain practices
for "eating vapor [i.e., pneuma]."
Several of them, like the meditation described here,
were to be carried out mornings and evenings.
We do not, in fact, know precisely what was different about the method
that the _Xiang'er_ espouses.
Perhaps it was merely that the Celestial Masters insisted
that these pneumas emanated from the Dao,
as proposed here.

[^intro-39]: This idea, too, derives from early breath cultivation,
as incorporated in Han cults of transcendence.
Harper (_Early Chinese Medical Literature_, sec. 4)
translates a passage from the Mawangdui medical texts
to the effect that "[t]hose who eat grain eat what is square;
those who eat vapor [pneuma] eat what is round.
Round is heaven; square is earth."
The avoidance of grain and ingestion of pneumas
to achieve corporeal transubstantiation
also figures in the _Liexian zhuan_ accounts of many Transcendents
and is ridiculed by Wang Chong (24:73).
In such cases, the dietary prohibition is severe.
Vegetable sustenance, such as pine nuts and calamus,
was proposed to replace grains, which were associated with decay and death.
Such a prohibition was not in effect among the early Celestial Masters,
who were known as the "Way of the Five Pecks of Rice"
and received faith payments in grain at the three assemblies
held each year at the parishes.

[^intro-40]: Lines 328-29.
As Rao Zongyi
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu jiaojian_ [Hong Kong: Tong Nam, 1956], p. 80)
notes,
this image appears already in the _Taiping jing_, where we read:
"The triply luminous is the heart.
It is in charge of ordering the Luminous Hall (Mingtang 明堂),
which communicates with the rays of sun and moon
and is named the completed paths of the three luminaries"
(_Taiping jing hejiao_,
ed. Wang Ming [Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1979], 114:596;
see also 3.4:17-20).
Other texts, including the "outer" _Scripture of the Yellow Court_,
commonly describe the _Mingtang_ as  a palace in the head.
See Kristofer M. Schipper,
_Concordance du Houang-t'ing King_ (Paris, 1975), p. 1 lines 32-35.

[^intro-41]: For an analysis
of the layout and significance of the _Mingtang_,
which was based on the cosmic diagram known as the River-Chart,
see Marc Kalinowski,
"La transmission du Dispositif des Neuf Palais sous les Six Dynasties,"
in Michel Strickmann, ed.,
_Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honour of R. A. Stein_,
vol. 3 (Brussels: Institut Belge des Hautes Études Chinoises, 1985),
pp. 773-811.

[^intro-42]: This concept of the three pneumas
seems to be drawn from the _Scripture of Great Peace_.
See the _Taiping jing_ 48:146 ff. passim;
and Kaltenmark, "Ideology of the _T'ai-p'ing ching_," pp. 26, 43.

[^intro-43]: This ritual was first studied
by Henri Maspero
(_Taoism and Chinese Religion_, trans. Frank A. Kierman, Jr.
[Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1981], pp. 536-41).
More recently, the ritual significance of the rite
has been detailed by Marc Kalinowski ("La transmission du Dispositif").

[^intro-44]: _HY_ 1284.
Although this text has yet to be subjected to a thorough-going study,
summaries of the ritual upon which the following account is based
are to be found in Kristofer M. Schipper, "The Taoist Body,"
_HR_ 17 (1978), pp. 355-86;
Kristofer M. Schipper, _The Taoist Body_,
trans. Karen C. Duval
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), pp. 150-52;
and Douglas Wile, _Art of the Bedchamber: The Chinese Sexology Classics_
(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), pp. 25-26.

[^intro-45]: On this latter point,
see especially Schipper, _The Taoist Body_.
The "five spirits" are deities who dwell
in the brain, the lungs, the liver, the heart, and the lower abdomen.
For more on the these spirits and the rite of "merging pneumas,"
see the _Purple Texts_, translated here.

[^intro-46]: In particular, see the Shangqing meditation practice
meant to replace "merging pneumas," translated and discussed
in the section of this book on the _Purple Texts_.

[^intro-47]: Mather, "Taoist Theocracy", pp. ro8-11;
and Yang Liansheng, "Laojun yinsong jiejing jiaoshi,"
_Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica_,
28 (1956), pp. 21-24.

[^intro-48]: See Bokenkamp, "_Xiang'er_ Commentary,"
for a fuller discussion of the views of Ōfuchi Ninji
and Kobayashi Masayoshi on this issue.

[^intro-49]: This is not an idea unique to this text.
See Harper, _Early Chinese Medical Literature_;
and Knoblock, _Xunzi_, pp. 78-80.

[^intro-50]: The word used to describe the formation of spirits
from pneuma in the text is, in fact, that used for the transformation
of water to ice: *jie* 結, "to tie, bind, coalesce."

[^intro-51]: The importance of preserving "essence,"
in this case too described as white and thus,
at least so far as its visible manifestation, equated with semen,
is mentioned again at lines 427-29.

[^intro-52]: As Donald Harper has noticed
in connection with the Mawangdui medical manuscripts, *jing*, "essence,"
is not equivalent to "semen," and the medical texts contain no words
that do denote "semen." (Harper, _Early Chinese Medical Literature_, sec. 4.)
Here, too, there is no word to express precisely what it is
that the youthful may not
(and that those of higher virtue are able to) "cut off" 絕.
When Chinese texts do wish to denote "semen" as the agent of reproduction,
they commonly employ the agricultural metaphor "seed" 種.
The discussion here, like that of the texts Harper has studied,
deals solely with the "essence"";
thus my interpolations.

[^intro-53]: The ellipses represent the _Laozi_ passage
that the second of these phrases glosses.

[^intro-54]: There is, at any rate, nothing in the commentary
that would indicate that the early Celestial Masters
did not practice the ritual of "merging pneumas."
Even if the evidence presented here is not accepted,
the most that might be said is that the _Xiang'er_ commentary
does not mandate the practice.

[^intro-55]: Seidel, "Traces of Han Religion in Funeral Texts Found in Tombs,"
in Akizuki Kan'ei, ed., _Dōkyō to shūkyō bunka_

[^intro-56]: For a Warring States account of resurrection,
see Donald Harper,
"Resurrection in Warring States Popular Religion,"
_TR_ 5.2 (1994), pp. 13-28.
Unfortunately, none of the _Xiang'er_ passages that speak of things
such as "transforming disintegration into renewal"
specify whether they are talking about this world or the heavens.

[^intro-57]: For the reincarnations of the Dao itself,
see the _Admonitions_, translated here.

[^intro-58]: Lines 427-29.

[^intro-59]: There is one reference to new life
and the return of essence to the root,
but this seems to concern only the preservation of essence
to maintain the vigor one enjoyed at birth (see lines 215-19).
On the Shangging practice, see the _Purple Texts_, translated here.

[^intro-60]: I have argued elsewhere that the term *shouyi*,
as it occurs in the _Xiang'er_,
is best translated as "maintaining unity," in that it here denotes
"a physico-spiritual wholeness,
the state in which a human being rejoins the Dao
through reintegrating its pneumas throughout the body"
(Bokenkamp, "_Xiang'er_ Commentary", pp. 46-49).
For the term *shouyi* in the Shangqing school,
see especially Isabelle Robinet,
_Taoist Meditation: The Mao-Shan Tradition of Great Purity_,
trans. Julian F. Pas and Norman J. Girardot
(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993), pp. 120-38.

[^intro-61]: For the likely significance of these numbers,
see the opening pages of the _Admonitions_.

[^intro-62]: The translation here is based
on the collated text of Ōfuchi Ninji (_Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 251-57).
Specific references to each of the precepts
are noted in the footnotes to the translation.

[^intro-63]: The interpolated line is 無為而無不為
for 无名 of the Mawangdui manuscripts.
See William G. Boltz,
"The Religious and Philosophical Significance
of the 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu in Light of the Ma-wang-tui Silk Manuscripts,"
_BSOAS_ 45 (1982), pp. 102-4.
In fact, the _Xiang'er_ gloss on this famous line
says nothing of "inaction," or,
to use Boltz's etymologically precise translation,
"minimalizing action."
It reads, in its entirety:

    > The nature of the Dao
is such that it does not perform evil deeds.
Thus it is spiritual and is creative of all things.
Daoists should take this as their model. (lines 572-73)

    The same is true of other occurrences of *wu wei* throughout the _Xiang'er_.
Interestingly, at chapter 10 of the received version,
where we read "are you able to be aware of the four reaches of space,
yet lack knowledge?" 明白四達能無知乎,
the _Xiang'er_ text reads instead:
"As awareness reaches the four quarters, *wu wei* 明白四達而無為"
The commentary to this passage says:

    > Those of higher attainment have open minds
and naturally increase their knowledge.
Knowing evil, they discard it;
knowing good, they are able to practice it.
They dare not perform evil 勿敢為惡事. (lines 119-20)

    This reinforces Boltz's contention
that it was religious Daoist readings of the _Laozi_
that imported the notion of *wu wei* into the text
where it had not occurred before,
but also shows that the reasons for which this was done
had little to do with the way Heshang Gong and Wang Bi
interpret the term.

[^intro-64]: Given Chinese physiological beliefs,
quieting the passions is in fact the same thing as "controlling pneuma,"
since, as explained earlier, the emotions were thought to result
from excesses of pneuma issuing from one of the five viscera.

[^intro-65]: Though it falls well beyond the scope of the present discussion,
it is worth suggesting that the _Xiang'er_ commentary
here too preserves earlier understandings of the _Laozi_
and that pre-Wang Bi occurrences of the term *wu wei*
should perhaps all be taken in this way.

[^intro-66]: Both terms refer to radical departures from the true and correct,
though *wei* 偽 is more often used for human actions.
The opposite of *wei* in this text, as generally,
is *zhen* 真, "correct, true, perfect."
The implication, probably derived from the language of craft,
is that the humanly produced is but a poor copy of the real thing.

[^intro-67]: Confucius is not, in fact, mentioned by name
in the text of the _Laozi_, but the commentary finds it there
by glossing the word *kong* 孔, "great,"
which is also Confucius's surname,
as a reference to the man himself. See lines 321-22.

[^intro-68]: This view is most forcefully expressed
in chapters 18 through 20 of the standard Laozi.

[^intro-69]: See, for instance, lines 9-12 and 117-19, passim.
It is true that the _Xiang'er_ commentator shows a marked disdain
for anything beyond the writings of the Dao.
The passage criticizing half of the five Confucian classics as "deviant"
goes on to state, "Beyond the five scriptures, all of the writings,
biographies, and records are the creations of corpses.
These are completely deviant" (lines 248-49).
The point at issue here, however, is that the commentary
departs from the intent of the _Laozi_
in sanctioning certain types of knowledge.
To see how distinctive this interpretation of the text actually is,
one need only compare lines 243-65 of the translation
with the Heshang Gong commentary on chapter 18 of the _Laozi_
(partially translated in Alan Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, pp. 121-22).

[^intro-70]: On early Confucian conceptions of heaven, see Robert Eno,
_The Confucian Creation of Heaven:
Philosophy and the Defense of Ritual Mastery_
(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990).

[^intro-71]: Lines 519-20.
According to traditional Chinese court etiquette,
military officers stood to the right of the emperor,
whereas civil officials stood to the left (see lines 485-87).

[^intro-72]: See footnote § on page 107.

[^intro-73]: This does not imply that the _Xiang'er_ commentary
simply "affirms Confucian virtues" or "absorbs Confucian thought,"
as Ren Jiyu (ed., _Zhongguo daojiao shi_
(Shanghai: Renmin chubanshe, 1990], p. 38) claims,
for it uniformly criticizes core Confucian concepts.
The Celestial Master movement, as we shall see in the _Admonitions_,
did eventually adopt Confucian virtues,
but only after the fall of the Hanzhong community.

[^intro-74]: Line 265. See also line 286 passim,
where the ruler is addressed in the third person---a common form
of honorific speech.

[^intro-79]: The commentary's attitude toward the military
follows that of the _Laozi_.
Weapons are "not propitious instruments,"
created by the Dao only to threaten those who do not reform (lines 463-64).
At the same time, the commentary does recognize
the need to fight when there is no recourse.
On such occasions, the enemy should be given three chances to submit,
and, upon victory, the dead enemy should be mourned
"as if there were a loss in your own family" (lines 489-91).

[^intro-80]: This point was made by Seidel
(_La divinisation de Lao-tseu_, p. 77).
See, for instance, lines 207-10.

[^intro-81]: Lines 489-91.

[^intro-82]: _HY_ 1119, 2a9.
The phrase "proclaim thrice the five commands" 三宣五令
is strikingly similar to the military practice
known as "five times proclaiming the three commands" 三令五申,
which was to be accomplished before the prayers for victory
at the start of a campaign.
See the _Kongcong zi_, attributed to Kong Fu (fl. ca. 240 B.C.E.),
cited in the DKW, 3:814b, and the _Shiji_, 65:2161,
for the militarist Sunzi's use of the commands.
This military terminology may stand behind the Celestial Master term,
but until the contents of the "five commands" are known,
it is impossible to say.

[^intro-83]: Rao Zongyi
(_Laozi xiang'er zhu xulun_,
in _Fukui bakase shōju kinen Tōyō bunka ronsha_ [Tokyo: Hirakawa, 1969])
lists fourteen references to the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
To these we might add the _Daojiao yishu_ (_HY_ 1121, 13b)
and Du Guangting's 杜光庭 (850-933)
_Taishang sandong chuanshou daode jing zixu lu baibiao yi_ (_HY_ 807, 15b).
It should be noted that many of these references
are to the _Xiang'er_ precepts,
which enjoyed an independent circulation (see later discussion),
rather than to the commentary itself.
Three citations of the _Xiang'er_ have survived,
but only one of these, the _Laozi_ commentary
of the Daoist Li Rong 李榮 (fl. ca. 620),
cites a portion of the commentary appearing in S 6825.
The citation is only forty-three graphs long
and differs only in a three insignificant particles
from the Dunhuang manuscript passage.
See Rao, _Laozi xiang'er zhu xulun_, pp. 1165-68.

[^intro-84]: See Chen Shixiang,
"_Xiang'er_ Laozi daojing Dunhuang canjuan lunzheng,"
_Ts'ing Hua Journal of Chinese Studies_, n.s., 1.2 (1957), p. 42;
and Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 294-96.

[^intro-85]: See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 294-98.

[^intro-86]: Zhang Daoling is cited as the author of the text
first in Tang works: the _Bianzheng lun_, composed by
the Buddhist Falin 法琳 (_T_ 2110, chap. 6, 52.531c27 ff.);
the _wai zhuan_ 外傳 to Li Longji's 李隆基 (r. 712-56) imperial commentary
to the _Laozi_ (_HY_ 679, 1b);
and Du Guangting's preface to the _Guang sheng yi_
commentary to the _Laozi_ (_HY_ 725, 1:1a).
The attribution to Zhang Lu occurs in somewhat earlier Daoist works:
the _Dongzhen taishang taixiao langshu_, which Ōfuchi Ninji
dates to the first half of the sixth century
(_HY_ 1341; see Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 281-86),
and the _Chuanshou jingjie yi zhujue_, which most likely dates
to the end of the Six Dynasties period
(_HY_ 1228, 3b; see Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 248;
and Rao, _Laozi xiang'er zhu xulun_, p. 1171 n. 9.
Interestingly, Lu Deming 陸德明 (ca. 550-ca. 630),
in his _Jingdian shiwen_, also reports the tradition
that the commentary was from the hand of Zhang Lu.
See William G. Boltz, "The 'Hsiang Erh' Lao-tzu," p. 95;
and, on the error of the attribution to Liu Biao also reported by Lu,
Chen Shixiang, "_Xiang'er_ Laozi," pp. 43-44.
From this, it seems clear that the tradition
connecting the _Xiang'er_ commentary to Zhang Lu is the earlier one.
It also seems likely that the attribution to Zhang Daoling
began in Buddhist polemics.

[^intro-87]: Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 247-52, 281-89.
For an analysis of the Dunhuang manuscript copies of the "Ge edition"
of the _Laozi_, see Kusuyama Haruki, "Dōtokukyōrui,"
Kōza: Tonkō to Chūgoku Dōkyō 4 (1983), pp 6-30.
There is also evidence that the Shangqing founder Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-?)
possessed and made his own hand copy
of this "Zhang Lu" version of the _Laozi_.
See Kusuyama, "Dōtokukyōrui," pp. 12-13;
see also Robinet, _La révélation du Shangqing_, vol. 2, p. 415.

[^intro-88]: There are, to be sure, influential dissenting voices.
Fukui Kōjun, Shima Kunio, Kusuyama Haruki, Naitō Motoharu, Mugitani Kunio
("Rōshi sōjichū ni tsuite," _Tōhō Gakubō_ 57 [1985], pp. 75-107),
and Kobayashi Masayoshi have all argued for later dates,
ranging from the fourth to the sixth century.
For a discussion of the work of the first four scholars,
see Kusuyama, "Dōtōkukyōrui," pp. 36-38;
and Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, pp. 109-11.
Kusuyama, Shima, and Naitō concern themselves
primarily with the version of the _Laozi_
found in the _Xiang'er_ commentary and attempt to place it
with respect to the Heshang Gong text and the "Ge edition."
The conclusions of the other scholars are based,
in large part, on their analyses of the development of early Daoist thought:
they attempt to establish the primacy of some textual reference
to a doctrine, idea, or term that, they assert,
must have influenced the _Xiang'er_.
As these arguments are complex and often dependent
on the dating of other texts, it is impossible to do justice to them here.
Beyond referring to a few places
where the views of these scholars are discussed---Mugitani's views
are refuted by Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 310-20),
Chan revisits the arguments surrounding the Heshang Gong,
and I have addressed some aspects of Kobayashi's opinions
in Bokenkamp, "The _Xiang'er_ Commentary"---I will assert here
only that I find arguments based on what little we now know
of the development of Daoist thought problematical and, at any rate,
not convincing enough to overturn the testimony
of the early Daoist texts that mention the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
The most compelling witness to the early date of the _Xiang'er_ commentary
is the _Admonitions_, itself written in 255.
(See my introduction to the translation to that text.)

[^intro-89]: Chen Shixiang first noticed that the nine prescriptive
and twenty-seven proscriptive precepts
of the _Taishang Laojun jinglü_ (_HY_ 785)
were derived from the _Xiang'er_.
Ōfuchi (_Shoki no dōkyō_) identifies two further copies
of the same lists (_HY_ 786, and _HY_ 463 chap. 5), collates them,
and studies the references to the precepts in other Daoist works.
Ōfuchi concludes that "expounding the precepts" was one of the main goals
of the _Xiang'er_ commentary.
I have argued against this opinion (Bokenkamp, "The _Xiang'er_ Commentary"),
proposing that it is more likely that the lists of precepts
were derived from the commentary later,
once the Celestial Master movement had come into regular contact
with Buddhist communities---something that would likely
not have occurred before the diaspora from Hanzhong.
One piece of evidence for this is that the other early Celestial Master text,
the _Admonitions_, although citing the _Xiang'er_,
does not mention precepts 誡/戒 even when it is citing
what later were called the _Xiang'er_ precepts,
but only the "prohibitions of Heaven" 天禁.
It seems likely, then, that all sorts of "prohibitions" and "admonitions"
were derived on an ad hoc basis from the commentary.
The term I have in fact translated as "precept" throughout
is written 誡 throughout the _Xiang'er_ manuscript
and means "admonition, remonstrance, warning."
It is used both as a verb and as a noun in the _Xiang'er_
and does not imply the preexistence of a list of precepts.
Further indication that the precepts did not exist in listed form
at the time the commentary was written is that the _Xiang'er_ author,
although not averse to numerical listings,
nowhere mentions the precepts by number.

[^intro-90]: See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, pp. 288-94.

[^intro-91]: The precept cited is number six
("Do not ... point to any shape and call it the Dao"),
one that is mentioned three times in the commentary.
(See Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 270;
and _HY_ 788, 6a of the _Admonitions_ translation in this book.)
Ōfuchi believes that the words *xiang er* 想爾 in this text
refer to the commentary.
I do not think this is so,
though they may be a punning reference to the title.
(See endnote 3 to the _Admonitions_ translation.)

[^intro-92]: _HY_ 788, 1943-7.

[^intro-93]: For a translation of the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi interpretations
of this line, see Chan, _Two Visions of the Way_, p. 165.

[^intro-94]: Since the commentary also advocates
that good actions be done in strict secrecy,
it is easy to see why good actions should leave no trace.

[^intro-95]: Rao, _Laozi xiang'er zhu xulun_, p. 1169;
Ōfuchi, _Shoki no dōkyō_, p. 298.

[^intro-96]: _HY_ 788, 15a-b.

[^intro-97]: See Wang Ming,
_Daojia he daojiao sixiang yanjiu_
(Beijing: Shehui kexue yuan, 1984), p. 237,
for the sensible suggestion that this division of the text
occurred as a result of the popularity of the *zhangju* 章句,
"chapter and verse," style of commentary
that gained favor during the Latter Han.

(Tokyo: Fukubu shoten), PP. 421-34.
