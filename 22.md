He does not make himself known and is thus bright.

> 聖人法道
The Sage models himself on the Dao.
有功不多
不見德能也
He does not make much of his achievements
and thus is not known for virtue or ability.

不自伐故有功
He does not hack away at his substance, and is thus possessed of merit.

> 惡者伐身之斧也
Evil is the axe that hacks away at the body.

thinks only of accumulating good deeds
in order to achieve physical longevity.

are degrading and lead to poverty and depletion,
but he does not feel sorry about injuries to his body
or provide it with fine clothes and excellent foods.

故莫能與爭
Since he does not contend,
none are able to contend with him.

有爭避之高逝
If there are those who wish to contend with him, he avoids them and disappears on high.
俗人如何能與之共爭乎
How then could the vulgar contend with him?

古之所謂曲則全
豈虛語
How could the ancient saying "What is bent will become whole" be false?
故成全而歸之
Thus you should complete this wholeness and return to it.

> 謙曲後全
明非虛語也
That what is bent and withdrawing will later[^xianger-39] be whole
and bright is not a false saying.

故重申示之也
Fearing that people will not understand,
\[the Dao\] repeats it here to instruct them.
