# Chapter 7

天長地久
Heaven endures and earth is longevous;
天地所以能長久者
以其不自生
故能長久
they are able to last long
because they do not themselves give birth.

> 能法道
故能自生而長久也
They are able to model themselves on the Dao
and consequently are able to endure for a long time by not giving birth.[^xianger-10]

是以聖人後其身而身先
This is why the Sage, though he places lowest priority on his body, finds his body given priority.

> 求長生者
不勞精思求財以養身
不以無功劫君取祿以榮身
不食五味以恣
Those who seek long life
do not squander their essence and thoughts in pursuit of wealth for the maintenance of their bodies,
nor do they try to coerce their lord, seeking emoluments to glorify themselves without merit,
nor do they become gluttonous through eating the five flavors.
衣弊履穿
不與俗爭
Clothed humbly,
they do not contend with the vulgar in fine shoes and clothes.
即為後其身也
而目此得仙壽獲福
在俗人先
In all of this, they place lower priority on their own bodies
and by this means[^xianger-11] achieve the longevity of the Transcendents. They thus obtain good fortune greater
than that achieved by all those vulgar persons.
即為身先
This is what is meant by "finding the body given priority."

外其身而身存
Regarding his body as something external, he finds his body preserved.

> 與上同義
The meaning of this phrase is the same as that above.

以其無屍[^rse-07-1]
故能成其屍
Because he is without a corpse,
he is able to perfect his corpse.[^xianger-12]

> 不知長生之道
身皆屍行耳
The bodies of those who do not know the Dao of long life
are but mobile corpses.
非道所行
悉屍行也
It is not the Dao that they practice,
but merely the way of the corpses.[^07-1]
道人所以得仙壽者
不行屍行
The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity of Transcendents
is that they do not practice the way of the corpses.
與俗別異
故能成其屍
令為仙士也
They differ from the vulgar
and thus are able to perfect their corpses,
allowing them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility.
