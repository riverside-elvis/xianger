# Chapter 27

善行無徹跡
Good deeds leave no trace.

> 信道行善
無惡跡也
When one keeps faith with the Dao and practices good,
there is no trace of evil.

善言無瑕適
Good words lack flaws and bring no blame.

> 人非道言惡
天輒奪[⿱竹下]
When people go against the Dao and speak evil,
heaven in each case subtracts counts of life.[^27-1]
今信道言善
教授不耶
則無過也
Now, when those who keep faith with the Dao speak good words
and instruct others not to go against the Dao,
there is no blame attached.

善計不用籌[⿱竹下]
Right calculations do not require counting sticks.

> 明計者心解
可不須用[⿱竹下]
Those who understand computation can solve problems in their minds
and do not need to use counters.
至心信道者
發自至誠
不須旁人自勸
Those who keep faith with the Dao to the depths of their hearts
do so in complete sincerity
and do not require others to urge them along.

善閉無關鍵不可開
When something is well closed, though there are no locks or bars, it cannot be opened.

> 心三川
There are three streams in the heart.
陽耶陰害
悉當閉之勿用
Both yang deviances and the yin harm
should be shut up and not employed.
中道為正
The central stream is the correct one.
至誠能閉耶志者
雖無關鍵
永不可開
Those of perfect sincerity who are able to shut up their deviant aspirations,
though they use no locks or bars,
will never release them.
不至誠者
雖有關鍵
猶可開也
\[As for\] those lacking perfect sincerity,
though they use locks and bars,
still [the floodgates] can be opened.[^27-2]

善結無繩約不可解
When something is well tied, though no ropes and cords are used, it cannot be dissolved.

> 結志求生
務從道誡
Fasten your will to the pursuit of life,
and labor to follow the precepts of the Dao.
至誠者為之
雖無繩約
永不可解
Those who are able to do this in complete sincerity, 
though they use no ropes and cords,
will never be dissolved.
不至誠者
雖有繩約
猶可解也
Those who lack sincerity,
though they use ropes and cords,
still may be dissolved.[^27-3]

是以聖人常善救人
而無棄人
This is why the Sage establishes goodness to save others
and does not forsake them.

> 常為善
見惡人不棄也
就往教之
示道誡
Ever performing good deeds,
the Sage, seeing evil persons, does not forsake them
but approaches to instruct them
by means of the precepts of the Dao.
讜其人不化
不可如何也
If those persons will not be converted,
there is nothing more that the Sage can do.

常善救物
而無棄物
The Sage is ever skilled at saving beings
and does not forsake them.

> 與上同義也
The meaning is the same as that of the preceding passage.

是謂襲明
This is called "putting on the luminous."

> 襲
常明也
Clothe yourself
in the constant brightness.
能知此意明明也
Those who understand this will be illumined.

善人不善人師
The good are masters to those who are not good.

> 不善人從善人學善
Those who are not good learn goodness from those who are;
故為師
thus these latter are masters.
終無善人從不善人學善也
There has never been an evil person who learned goodness from another evil person.

不善人善人之資
The bad are a resource for the good.

> 善人無惡
乃以惡人為資
The good have no evil in them
and thus use evil persons as a resource.
若不善人見人其惡不可
善人益自勤勸
When an evil person appears before them, good people see that evil is intolerable
and increase their efforts at self-reform.

不貴其師
不愛其資
雖知大迷
When teachers are not valued
and the resource is not cherished,
although knowledge abounds, there is great confusion.

> 不善人不貴善人
善人不以惡人自改
皆為大迷也
When the evil do not value the good
and when the good do not use the evil to reform themselves,
both are greatly mistaken.

此謂要妙
This is the essential and wondrous teaching.

> 明知此甚要妙也
Those who fully understand this are treasured and wondrous.
