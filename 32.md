# Chapter 32

道常無名
The Dao is ever nameless.

> 不名大
託微小也
When not taking the name of "the great,"
it entrusts itself to the tiny.

樸雖小
天下不敢臣
Though in its simplicity it is small,
none under heaven dare to make it their servant.

> 道雖微小
為天下母
Though the Dao be minuscule,
it is the mother of all under heaven.
故不可得臣
Thus it may not be made a servant.

王侯若能守
萬物將自賓
Were kings and lords able to maintain it,
the myriad things would all serve them as guests.

> 人不可以貴輕道
Humans must not, even if they are exalted, belittle the Dao.
當之
萬物皆自賓伏
When you are equal to this,
everything in the world will submit naturally.

天地相合
以降甘露
Heaven and earth would join
in dropping sweet dew.

> 王者行道
天地憙
滋澤生
Heaven and earth rejoice when the king practices the Dao,
and life-giving moisture is produced.[^32-1]

民莫之令而自均
The populace would naturally make themselves equals without having been ordered to do so.

> > 王者尊道
When the king reveres the Dao,  
吏民企效
His officers and subjects will desire to emulate him.  
不畏法律
乃畏天神
They will not fear laws and regulations, but the spirits of heaven.  
敢為非惡
皆欲全身
They will not dare commit wrongs but will desire only to perfect their bodies.  
不須令敕而自平均
They will make themselves equals without having been commanded to do so.[^xianger-56]

始制有名
First regulate those with fame.

> 道人求生
不貪榮名
The people of the Dao seek life and do not covet honor and fame.
今王侯承先人之後
有榮名
Now, the kings and lords have inherited honor and fame.
不強求也
They have not striven for these things.[^32-2]
道聽之
但欲令務尊道行誡
勿驕溢也
The Dao understands this
and desires only that they labor to revere the Dao and practice the precepts,
being neither proud nor overbearing.

名亦既有
夫亦將知止
People who already possess fame should know when to stop.

> 王侯承先人之後
既有名
當知止足
不得復思高尊強求也
Since kings and lords
inherit fame from their ancestors,
they should know how to stop when they reach sufficiency
and should not seek further rank and honor.

知止不殆
Those who know when to stop are not endangered.

> 諸知止足
終不危殆
All those who know to stop with sufficiency
will never be threatened or harmed.[^32-3]

譬道在天下
猶川谷與江海
If one were to find a comparison for the Dao here in the world,
it would be like streams and valleys joining with the great rivers and the seas.

> 道在天下
譬如江海
The Dao works in the world
in a fashion similar to the interaction of the rivers and the seas.
人一心志道
當如谷水之欲歸海也
When people wholeheartedly aspire to the Dao
they are like the water of the valleys, which desires to return to the sea.
