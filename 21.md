# Chapter 21

孔德之容
唯道是從
The all-encompassing nature of Confucius's virtue
came precisely from his following the Dao.[^21-1]

> 道甚大
The Dao is greater than all else.
教孔丘為知
It taught Confucius all that he knew.
後世不信道文
但上孔書
以為無上
Those of later generations have not kept faith with the writings of the Dao,
but merely revere Confucius's writings,
considering them the highest.
道故明之
告後賢
This is why the Dao clarifies the situation
to inform later worthies.

道之為物
唯慌唯惚
As an object,
the Dao is obscure and indistinct.

> 道微
獨能慌惚不可見也
The Dao is subtle.
Since it is invisible, we can comprehend it only obscurely.

慌惚中有物
In the midst of its obscurity there are things.
惚慌中有像
In the midst of its obscurity there are images.

> 不可以道不見故輕也
One should not slight the Dao because it is invisible.
中有大神氣
In its midst are the great spirit pneumas;
故喻囊龠
that is why it is likened to a bellows' sack.[^21-2]

窈冥中有精
In the midst of its dark depths are essences.

> 大除中也
有道精分之與萬物
萬物精共一本
Within its vast precincts
are the essences of the Dao.
These are apportioned out to the ten thousand things
so that the essences of the ten thousand things all have a single root.

其精甚真
Its essences are fully realized.

> 生死之官也
These are the officials of life and death.
精其真
當寶之也
Since the essences are fully realized,
you should treasure them.

其中有信
They contain tokens of faith.

> 古仙士寶精以生
The ancient Transcendent nobles treasured[^xianger-35] the essences to gain life.
今人失精以死
Today's people lose the essences and die.
大信也
These are [the Dao's] eminent tokens of good faith!

> 今但結精
便可得生乎
Now, is it true that one can,[^xianger-36] merely through congealing the essences, obtain life?
不也
No.
要諸行當備
It is essential that all of the practices be fulfilled.
所以精者道之別氣也
This is because essence is a variant form of the pneumas of the Dao.
入人身中為根本
It enters into the human body as the root and the source.
持其半
乃先言之
What happens when one holds only half of it
I have already explained.
夫欲寶精
百行當備
萬善當著
Whoever desires to treasure the essences 
needs to practice one hundred sorts of actions
and accomplish ten thousand sorts of merit.
調和五行
喜怒悉去
One should harmonize the five phases
and banish all joy and anger.
天曹左契
\[ ⿱竹下\][^rse-21-1]有餘數
精乃守之
When, on the left tally of the celestial officers,
one has extra counts of life,
the essences will maintain them.[^21-3]
惡人寶精
唐自苦終不居
必自泄[^rse-21-2]漏也
When evil persons treasure their essences,
they trouble themselves in vain,
for in the end their essence will not remain, but must certainly leak away.

> 心應規制萬事
The heart corresponds to the compass. It regulates the myriad matters;
故號明堂
三道布陽耶陰害
以中正度道氣
thus it is called the
"three paths of the Luminous Hall."
While dispersing deviances of yang and injuries of yin,
it holds to the center and correctly measures out the pneumas of the Dao.

> 精並喻像池水
身為池堤封
The essences might be compared to the waters of a pond
and the body to the embankments along the sides of the pond.
善行為水源
Good deeds are like the water's source.
若斯三備
池乃全堅
If these three things are all complete,
the pond will be sturdy.
心不專善
無堤封
水必去
If the heart does not fix itself on goodness,
then the pond lacks embankments
and the water will run out.
行善不積
源不通
水必燥乾[^rse-21-3]
If one does not accumulate good deeds,
the pond is cut off at its source
and the water will dry up.
決水溉野
渠如溪江
雖堤在
源水不泄
必亦空
If one breaches the dike to irrigate fields
as if it were a river or stream,
then, even though the embankments hold,
the original flow will leak off too
and the pond will empty.[^21-4]
\[⿴行山\][^rse-21-4]燥炘裂
百病並生
When the bed of the pond becomes scorched and cracked,
that is the various illnesses all emerging.
斯三不慎
池為空坑也
If one is not cautious about these three things,
the pond will become an empty ditch.

自古及今
其名不去
From ancient times to the present day,
its name has abided.

> 古今常共此一道
Today, as in ancient times, there has been but one Dao.
不去離人也
It does not forsake humanity.

以閱眾甫
This is how it scrutinizes ends and beginnings.[^xianger-37]

> 道有以來
更閱終始
Since the Dao came into existence,
it has repeatedly scrutinized the differences between the ends and beginnings [of things].
\[非
一也
甫者
始也\][^rse-21-5]

吾何以知終甫之然
How do I know the ends and beginnings to have been so?
以此
By means of this.

> 吾
道也
"I"
here refers to the Dao.
所以知古今終始共此一道
The reason it knows of both ancient and modern times, of ends and beginnings, is that it has been throughout the one Dao.
其事如此也
This is its function.
