# Chapter 9

持而滿之
不若其己
Holding it and filling it
is not so good as leaving it alone.
揣而悅之
不可長寶
Though one delights in controlling it,
one may not treasure it for long.

> 道教人結精成神
The Dao teaches people to congeal their essences and form spirits.
今世間偽伎詐稱道
託黃帝
玄女
龔子
容成之文
Today, there are in the world false practitioners who craftily proclaim the Dao,
teaching by means of texts attributed to the Yellow Thearch,
the Dark Maiden,
Gongzi,
and Rongcheng.[^09-1]
相教從女不施
思還精補腦
They say that during intercourse with a woman one should not release the semen,
but through meditation return its essence to the brain to fortify it.
心神不一
失其所守
Since their [internal] spirits and their hearts are not unified,
they lose that which they seek to preserve.[^09-2]
為揣悅
不可長寶
Though they control their delight,
they may not treasure it for long.
若
如也
"As"
is comparative here.
不如直自然如也
"Not so good as" means to run counter to the natural order of things.

金玉滿堂
莫之能守
Though gold and jade might fill their chamber,
no one is able to preserve them.

> 人之精氣滿藏中
Essence and pneuma fill the viscera.
苦無愛守之者
不肯自然閉心
而揣捝之
即大迷矣
Those who do not cherish and preserve them,
who are unwilling to naturally close the heart
so that it might thereby control and harmonize [their essence and pneumas],[^xianger-16]
are greatly deluded.

富貴而驕
自遺咎
Those made arrogant by riches and ennoblement
bring loss and injury upon themselves.

> 精結成神
陽炁有餘
務當自愛
閉心絕念
If, once one has congealed one's essences and formed spirits,
there are excess yang pneumas,
one should strive to cherish the self
and, shutting the heart, cut off longings.
不可驕欺陰也
It is not permissible to arrogantly deceive the yin.[^09-3]
驕欺
咎即成
Through such arrogance and deceit,
injury derives.
又外說
秉權富貴而驕世
即有咎也
Also, the external explanation of this passage
is that those who are arrogant toward the rest of the world by virtue of their power, riches, and high rank
bring calamity upon themselves.[^09-4]

名成功遂身退
When fame and accomplishment are achieved, the body declines;
天之道
this is the Dao of heaven.[^xianger-17]

> 名與功
身之仇
Fame and accomplishment
are the enemies of the body;
功名就
身即滅
when they are achieved,
the body is obliterated.
故道誡之
This is why the Dao prohibits them.[^09-5]
范蠡乘舟去
道意謙信
When Fan Li departed by boat,
it was because he humbly trusted the intentions of the Dao.
不隱身形剝
His body was not destroyed when he went into reclusion;
是其效也
this is the efficacy of the Dao.[^09-6]
