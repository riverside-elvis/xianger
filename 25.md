# Chapter 25

有物混成
先天地生
There is a substance formed in undifferentiation,
born before heaven and earth.
家漠獨立不改
Lone[^xianger-44] and independent, it does not change.
周行不殆
It travels in cycles without end.
可以為天下母
It can serve as the mother of all under heaven.

> 嘆無名大道之巍巍也
真天下之母也
This passage sings the magnificence of the nameless Dao,
in truth the mother of all below heaven.

吾不知其名
字之曰道
I do not know its name,
so I style it "the Dao."

> 吾
道也
"I"
refers to the Dao.
還嘆道美
This again sings the perfection of the Dao.
難可名字
故曰道也
Since it is difficult to find an appropriate name for it,
it is called the Dao.

吾強為之名曰大
Were I forced to give it a name, I would pronounce it "the great."

> 言道甚大
This means that the Dao is the greatest of all things.
言強者
恐不復不能副其德也
When it says "forced,"
it means that it fears there is no alternative. There is nothing to match its power.

大曰逝
When the Great says, "Be gone,"

> 逝
去也
"Be gone"
means to drive away.
大神無能制者
便立能去之也
When there are great spirits that nothing can control,
the Dao immediately drives them off.

逝曰遠
they are banished, and the Dao says, "To a great distance."

> 翕然便能遠去也
In a trice, it is able to drive them off to a distance.

遠曰反
When they are at a distance, the Dao says, "Return."

> 翕然便能還反也
In a trice, it is able to bring them back.

道大天大地大生大
The Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and life is great.[^xianger-45]

> 四大之中
何者最大乎
Among these four great things,
which is greatest?
道最大也
The Dao is greatest.

域中有四大
而生處一
Within the realm there are four great things,
and life is one of them.

> 四大之中
所以令生處一者
生
道之別體也
The reason that life occupies one of the four positions
is that it is a separate physical manifestation of the Dao.

人法地
Humanity patterns itself on earth.
地法天
Earth patterns itself on heaven.
天法道
Heaven patterns itself on the Dao.
道法自然
The Dao is patterned on what is so of itself.

> 自然者
與道同號異體
"That which is so of itself"
is a variant name for the Dao.
令更相法
皆共法道也
Although these things pattern themselves on one another in this fashion,
they all alike are patterned on the Dao.
天地廣大
常法道以生
Heaven and earth are vast,
yet they constantly pattern themselves on the Dao to gain life.
況人可不敬道乎
Should not human beings then revere the Dao?
