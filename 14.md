# Chapter 14

視之不見
名曰夷
Looking at it without seeing it,
we call it "even."
聽之不聞
名曰希
Listening for it without hearing it,
we call it "widespread."
摶之不得
名曰微
Touching it without grasping it,
we call it "subtle."

> 夷者
平且廣
"Even"
means spread evenly and widely.
希者
大度形
"Widespread"
means greatly surpassing form.
微者
道炁清
"Subtle"
refers to the fact that the pneumas of the Dao are clear and transparent.
此三事欲嘆道之德美耳
These three things are merely ways of praising the power and beauty of the Dao.

此三者不可致詰
These three aspects cannot be separately analyzed;
故混而為一
thus they are merged in undifferentiation as the One.

> 此三者淳說道之美
These three things express the beauty of the Dao in simple language.
道者天下萬事之本
The Dao is the root of the ten thousand affairs of the world.
詰之者所況多
竹素不能勝載也
The aspects of the Dao that might be separately examined are so many
that there is not enough bamboo and silk to write of them all.
故還歸一
Consequently, we go back to its reversion to the One.
多者何傷
What would be the harm in analyzing one of its many aspects?
樸散淳薄更入耶
故不可詰也
The Dao may not be analyzed because, by doing this, we falsify its simplicity, lose its undifferentiation, and diffuse it to the extent that
it is one with the deviant.

其上不皦
Its ascent brings no [visible] brightness;
其下不忽
its descent brings no [audible] whoosh.

> 道炁常上下
經營天地內外
The pneumas of the Dao constantly ascend and descend,
active in heaven and on earth, within and without.
所以不見
清微故也
The reason they are not seen
is that they are clear and subtle.
上則不皦
Ascending on high, they do not shine;
下則不忽
忽有聲也
descending, they do not hu [whoosh],
which means "to move quickly with sound."

蠅蠅不可名
Floating about, it cannot be named.
復歸於無物
Again it returns to nothing.

> 道如是不可見名
The Dao is like this. It cannot be named.
如無所有也
It is as if there were nothing there.

是無狀之狀
無物之像
It is the formless form,
the insubstantial image.

> 道至尊
The Dao is of the highest worthiness.
微而隱
無狀貌形像也
Hidden away in its subtlety,
it has no shape or physical image.
但可從其誡
不可見知也
Since it cannot be seen or known,
one can only follow its precepts.
今世間偽伎
指形名道
Now, those who practice false arts in the mortal world
point to shapes and call them the Dao.
令有服色名字狀貌長短
They assign to these shapes variously colored garments, names, appearances, and heights.
非也
This is false.
悉耶偽耳
Such things are entirely deviant fabrications.[^14-1]

是謂惚慌
This is called the vague and indistinct.
迎不見其首
In greeting it, one may not see its head;
隨不見其後
in following it, one may not see its back.

> 道明不可見知
無形像也
The brilliance of the Dao may not be seen,
since it has neither shape nor image.

執古之道
以御[^rse-14-1]今之有
Grasp the Dao of the ancients
in order to control the existence of [those in] the present.

> 何以知此道今端有
How can we now know that the Dao truly exists?
觀古得仙壽者悉行之
Observe those of ancient times who achieved transcendence and longevity.
All of them practiced the Dao to achieve their station.
以得知今俗有不絕也
This is how we know that the Dao has not disappeared in the present profane age.

以故古始
Thereby you will know its ancient origins.
是謂道紀
This is called the thread of the Dao.

> 能以古仙壽若喻
今自勉厲守道真
即得道綱紀也
Those who are able to take the transcendent and longevous of ancient times as models
in order to urge themselves along in holding to the perfection of the Dao
will thereby grasp the guiding threads of the Dao.
