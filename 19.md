# Chapter 19

絕聖棄知
民利百倍
If sages were no more and knowledge were discarded,
the people would benefit a hundredfold.

> 謂詐聖知耶文者
This refers to deceptive sages with their knowledge of deviant writings.
夫聖人天所挺
生必有表
Those sages whom heaven selects
are invariably accompanied by some expression of that selection.
河雒著名
The Yellow and the Luo Rivers proclaim the Sage's name.[^19-1]
然常宣真
不至受有誤
Moreover, [such sages] constantly expound the truth and will not transmit falsehoods.
耶道不信明聖人之言
Those of the deviant ways do not place their faith in the words of enlightened sages.
故令千百歲大聖演真
滌徐耶文
That is why for hundreds and thousands of years the great sages have been compelled to rehearse the truth,
eradicating deviant writings.

> 今人無狀
The people of today are without accomplishment.
載通經藝
未貫道真
便自稱聖
They master the scriptures and the arts and,
without having understood the truth of the Dao,
proclaim themselves sages.[^19-2]
不因本而章篇自揆
As they measure themselves only against chapter and verse, this "sagehood" has no basis.
不能得道
Such as these are not able to receive the words of the Dao.
言先為身
不勸民真道可得仙壽
修善自勤
They place themselves first
and do not encourage people to individually strive in the practice of goodness so that, through the true Dao, the people might themselves obtain the longevity of Transcendents.
反言仙自有骨錄
非行所臻
On the contrary, such "sages" say that Transcendents already have their fates inscribed in their bones
and that this is not something one might achieve through deeds.[^19-3]
雲無生道
道書欺人
Or they say that there is no Dao of life
and that the books of the Dao deceive people.[^19-4]
此乃罪盈三千
In this way, their transgressions reach the full three thousand.[^19-5]
為大惡人
至令後學者不復信道
They cause great harm to humanity,
even to the extent that those who come later to the study do not keep faith with the Dao.
元元不旋
Thus, in myriad ways, the circle is broken.
子不念供養
Sons do not care to support their fathers;
民不念田
the people have no thought for their fields.
但逐耶學
傾側師門
They pursue only deviant learning,
lining up outside the doors of deviant masters.
盡氣誦病
到於窮年
They exhaust all of their energies chanting flawed teachings,
even to the end of their days.
會不能忠孝至誠感天
Finding that they are unable to move heaven through sincere practice of loyalty and filiality;
民治身不能仙壽
that, though they attempt to regulate their bodies, they are unable to reach the longevity of Transcendents;
佐君不能致太平
民用此不息
倍城邑虛空
and that, though they try to aid their lord, they are unable to bring about Great Peace---still
the people employ these unproductive teachings unceasingly,
even to the point that the capitals and cities are deserted.[^19-6]
是故絕詐聖耶知
不絕真聖道知也
This is why we should discard deceiving sages with their deviant knowledge
and allow the true sages with their knowledge of the Dao to continue uninterrupted.

絕仁棄義
民復孝慈
Eliminate humaneness, discard responsibility,
and the people will return to filiality and benevolence.

> 治國法道
聽任天下仁義之人
勿得強賞也
When the kingdom is ruled in a manner patterned on the Dao 
and when those of humanity and responsibility in the world are employed,
there is no need for force or reward.
所以者
尊大其化
廣聞道心
This is because
people will become humane and responsible once their moral transformation is valued
and the mind of the Dao is fully open to all.
人為仁義
自當至誠
天自賞之
不至誠者
天自罰之
Those who are sincere
by themselves
will naturally be rewarded by heaven,
and those who are not
will naturally be punished by heaven.
天察必審於人
Heaven's scrutiny is even more thoroughgoing than any human being's.
皆知尊道畏天
It knows fully who reveres the Dao and fears heaven.
仁義便至誠矣
All humaneness and duty will thus be sincere.

> 今王政強賞之
民不復歸天
Nowadays kings rule through force and reward,
so the people no longer give allegiance to heaven.
見人可欺
便詐為仁義
欲求祿賞
When they see an opportunity,
they feign humaneness and duty
in order to receive emoluments or rewards.
旁人雖知其都交
見得官祿
便復慕之
詐為仁義
終不相及也
Those observing this, though they know the actions are just outward show,[^xianger-31]
see how such persons obtain official position
thereby and respect them for it,
practicing false humanity and duty in their turn---so
that the cycle never ends.
世人察之不審
Mortal scrutiny of good and evil deeds is just not thorough enough.
故絕之勿賞
民悉自復慈孝矣
But if human rewards were discontinued,
all would revert to benevolence and filiality on their own.
此義平忤俗夫心
久久自解
與道合矣
The reason for their doing so runs counter to the common sense of the ordinary person, 
but after a long time they will come to understand
and will join with the Dao.
人君深當明之也
The ruler of humanity should be fully cognizant of this.

絕巧棄利
盜賊無有
Eliminate skill and discard profit,
and there will be no robbers or thieves. 

> 耶巧也
This means deviant "skills."
所得財寶也
"Profit" refers to all treasures gained thereby.
世不用之
盜賊亦不利也
If the world does not employ deviant knowledge,
robbers and thieves will cease to profit.

此三言為文未足
Texts written [on the basis of] these three sayings are still insufficient.
故令有所屬
Allow me, then, to append the following:
見素抱樸
be unadorned and embrace simplicity. 

> 三事天下大亂之源
The three things mentioned above are the source of great disorder in the world.
欲演散之
億文復不足
If you wish to promulgate this fact,
a million texts would still not be enough.
竹素不勝矣
There is not enough bamboo and silk for the job.[^xianger-32]
受故令屬此道文
As a result, this text of the Dao has been added.
不在外書也
Its truths are not to be found in other writings.
揲說其大略
可知之為亂原
Its general explanation of these three things
is sufficient to show that they are the source of disorder.

少私寡欲
Lessen self-interest and decrease your desires.

> 道之所說
無私少欲於世俗耳
What the Dao means
by being without self-interest is that one should have few desires for the vulgar things of this world.
