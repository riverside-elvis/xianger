# Chapter 16

致虛極
To summon emptiness is absurd;
守靜篤
maintain tranquillity and regulate yourself.

> 道真自有常度
The perfection of the Dao contains within itself a constant measure.
人不能明之
必復企暮（慕）
Unable to fully comprehend it,
humans must nonetheless strive toward it.
世間常為伎
因出教授
指形名道
Those mortals who continually practice false arts
thus promulgate their teachings,
pointing at forms and calling these the Dao.
令有處所服色
長短有分數
而思想之
They hold that it has a residence, garments of a specific color,
and a specific height,
so that one might thereby meditate upon it.[^xianger-26]
苦極無福報
此虛詐耳
In so doing, they bring intense suffering upon themselves without propitious recompense,
since it is all empty trickery.
強欲令虛詐為真
甚極
不如守靜自篤也
Although they are extremely ardent in their desire that this empty deception might be made real,
they would be better off
maintaining stillness and [practicing] self-regulation.

萬物並作
The myriad things arise in concert;
吾以觀其復
by this means I observe their return.
夫物芸芸
各歸其根
All the things in their crowded profusion---
each returns to its root.

> 萬物含道精
The myriad things all contain the essences of the Dao.
並作
初生起時也
"Arise in concert"
refers to the moment of their birth or their first growth.
吾
道也
"I"
refers to the Dao.
觀其精復時
皆歸其根
When the Dao observes its essences returning,
each "returns to its root."
故令人寶慎恨也
This is why the Dao commands that people treasure and be cautious concerning their own "root."[^16-1]

歸根日靜
Returning to the root is called "stillness."

> 道氣歸根
愈當清凈也
When the pneumas of the Dao return to the root,
it is even more important to maintain clarity and stillness.

靜曰復命
Stillness is called "restoring destiny."
復命曰常
The restoration of destiny is called "the constant."

> 知寶根清靜
復命之常法也
Knowing how to treasure the root in clarity and stillness
is the constant method of restoring one's life.

知常明
Knowing the constant, one is enlightened.

> 知此常法
乃為明耳
Knowing this constant method,
one is enlightened.

不知常
妄作兇
Not knowing the constant,
one blindly creates disaster.

> 世間常偽伎
不知常意
Those mortals who continually practice the false arts
do not know the significance of the constant.
妄有指書
故悉兇
They blindly point to their writings,
and thus all is disaster for them.

知常容
Know the constant aspect.

> 知常法意
常保形容
Those who know the meaning of the constant method
constantly preserve their form and aspect.

容能公
Those with the aspect are able to be impartial.

> 以道保形容
為天地上容
With the Dao preserving their shape and aspect,
they present an aspect ennobled by heaven and earth.
處天地間
不畏死
故公也
Positioned between heaven and earth,
they do not fear death
and are therefore impartial.

公能生
Impartiality is able to give life.

> 能行道公政
故常生也
Able to practice the Dao and make governance impartial,
they live extended lives.

生能天
This life is able to make them celestial.

> 能致長生
則副天也
Able to achieve long life,
they then assist heaven.

天能道
The celestial is able to join with the Dao.

> 天能久生
法道故也
The reason heaven is able to provide enduring life
is that it patterns itself on the Dao.

道能久
The Dao is able to cause them to endure.

> 人法道意
便能長久也
If people are able to pattern themselves on the Dao's intentions,
they will be able to endure.

沒身不殆
Their bodies obliterated, they do not perish.

> 太陰道積練形之宮也
Grand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao refine their forms.[^16-2]
世有不可處
賢者避去託死
過太陰中
而復一邊生像
When there is no place for them to stay in the world,
the worthy withdraw and, feigning death,
pass through Grand Darkness
to have their images reborn on the other side.
沒而不殆也
This is to be "obliterated without perishing."
俗人不能積善行
死便真死
The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds,
so when they die it is truly death.
屬地官去也
They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices.[^16-3]
