太上下知有之
Those with the highest [knowledge] possess the lowest knowledge.[^xianger-27]

> 知道
上知也
知也惡事
下知也
Knowing the Dao
is the highest knowledge---true knowledge. Evil deeds
represent the lowest knowledge.
雖有上知
當具識惡事
改之不敢為也
Even though one possesses the highest knowledge,
one should also fully recognize what is evil
for the purpose of reforming it so that none dare do evil.

其次親之譽之
Those with less knowledge---draw near to them and praise them.

曉道意
可親也
Seeing those who pursue goodness
and understand the intentions of the Dao,
you may draw near to them.
見學善之人
勤勤者
可就譽也
Seeing those who study goodness
and labor diligently,
you may approach them and praise them.
復教勸之
勉力助道宣教
You should further instruct them,
urging them to exert themselves in service of the Dao, spreading its teachings.

其次畏之
Those with even less knowledge---terrify them

> 見惡人
誡為說善
When you observe evil persons,
admonish them concerning their willfulness and explain good actions to them.

They may then be instructed and reformed.
就申道誡示之
畏以天威
令自改也
Draw near to them and explain to them the admonitions of the Dao,
terrifying them with the awesome might of heaven
so that they will reform themselves.

悔之
or disgrace them.

> 為惡人說善
不化而甫笑之者
此即芻茍之徒耳
非人也
When you preach goodness to evil persons,
those who are not transformed and who ridicule you
are nothing but disciples of the straw dog,
not humans.[^17-1]
可欺侮也
You should revile and disgrace them.
勿與語也
Do not speak with them.

信不足
有不信
Those not worth trusting
are faithless.

> 芻茍之徒
內信不足
故不信善人之言也
The disciples of the straw dog
lack inner trustworthiness
and thus will not put faith in the words of the good.

猶其貴言
成功事遂
Still, for those who value words,
accomplishment will follow.

> 道之所言
無一可棄者
Not one of the words of the Dao may be discounted.
得仙之士
但貴道言
Those who achieve Transcendence
do so by simply honoring the words of the Dao.
故輒成功事遂也
In all cases, accomplishment follows.

百姓謂我自然
Common people say of me that I am self-actualized.

> 我
仙士也
"Me"
refers to the Transcendent noble.
百姓不學我有貴信道言
以致此功
而意我自然
The common people do not imitate my example---that
it was reverence of and keeping faith with the words of the Dao that brought this accomplishment---thinking
instead that I am "self-actualized."[^17-2]
當示不肯企及效我也
Those unwilling to imitate me should be instructed.
